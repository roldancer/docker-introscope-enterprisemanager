THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.

#           previous Modifications.
#  
#      1.10. "Original Code" means Source Code of computer software code
#      which is described in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit A as
#      Original Code, and which, at the time of its release under this
#      License is not already Covered Code governed by this License.
#  
#      1.10.1. "Patent Claims" means any patent claim(s), now owned or
#      hereafter acquired, including without limitation,  method, process,
#      and apparatus claims, in any patent Licensable by grantor.

#      1.11. "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Covered Code for
#      making modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus
#      any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control
#      compilation and installation of an Executable, or source code
#      differential comparisons against either the Original Code or another
#      well known, available Covered Code of the Contributor's choice. The
#      Source Code can be in a compressed or archival form, provided the
#      appropriate decompression or de-archiving software is widely available
#      for no charge.
#  
#      1.12. "You" (or "Your")  means an individual or a legal entity
#      exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this
#      License or a future version of this License issued under Section 6.1.

#      The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
#      non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
#      claims:
#           (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
#           trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
#           modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
#           Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or
#           as part of a Larger Work; and
#  
#           (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or
#           selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice,
#           sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the
#           Original Code (or portions thereof).
#  
#           (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are
#           effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
#           Original Code under the terms of this License.
#  
#           (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
#           granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
#           separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused
#           by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the
#           combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.
#  
#      2.2. Contributor Grant.
#      Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor
#      hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license
#  
#           (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
#           trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,
#           display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
#           created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an
#           unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code
#           and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
#  
#           (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or
#           selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone
#           and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
#           of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
#           made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
#           Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
#           Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
#           Version (or portions of such combination).
#  
#           (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
#           effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of
#           the Covered Code.
#  
#           (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
#           granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
#           Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;
#           3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
#           Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made
#           by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
#           Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
#           infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
#           that Contributor.
#  
# 3. Distribution Obligations.
#  
#      3.1. Application of License.
#      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
#      governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
#      Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
#      distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
#      of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
#      copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
#      distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
#      version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
#      License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
#      an additional document offering the additional rights described in
#      Section 3.5.
#  
#      3.2. Availability of Source Code.
#      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
#      made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
#      either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
#      Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
#      Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
#      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
#      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
#      (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
#      has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
#      ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
#      Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
#  
#      3.3. Description of Modifications.
#      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
#      file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
#      the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
#      the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
#      Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
#      Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
#      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
#      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
#  
#      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
#           (a) Third Party Claims.
#           If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
#           intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
#           granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
#           Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
#           distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
#           party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
#           know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
#           the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
#           Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
#           Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
#           (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
#           reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
#           Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
#  
#           (b) Contributor APIs.
#           If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
#           interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
#           are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
#           also include this information in the LEGAL file.
#  
#                (c)    Representations.
#           Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
#           Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
#           Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
#           Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
#           this License.
#  
#      3.5. Required Notices.
#      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
#      Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
#      Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
#      location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
#      to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
#      You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
#      Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
#      for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
#      rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
#      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
#      obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
#      may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
#      Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
#      any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
#      offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
#      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
#      Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
#      support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
#  
#      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
#      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
#      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
#      and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
#      the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
#      including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
#      obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
#      in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
#      collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
#      Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
#      Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
#      contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
#      compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
#      Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
#      rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
#      License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
#      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
#      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
#      Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
#      Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
#      the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
#      terms You offer.
#  
#      3.7. Larger Works.
#      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
#      not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
#      Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
#      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
#  
# 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
#  
#      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
#      License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
#      statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
#      the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
#      describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
#      must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
#      be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
#      extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
#      sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
#      understand it.
#  
# 5. Application of this License.
#  
#      This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
#      attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
#  
# 6. Versions of the License.
#  
#      6.1. New Versions.
#      Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
#      and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
#      will be given a distinguishing version number.
#  
#      6.2. Effect of New Versions.
#      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
#      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
#      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
#      of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
#      other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
#      Covered Code created under this License.
#  
#      6.3. Derivative Works.
#      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
#      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
#      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
#      the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
#      "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
#      license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
#      and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
#      contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
#      Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
#      Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
#      Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
#      this License.)
#  
# 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
#  
#      COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
#      WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
#      WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
#      DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
#      THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
#      IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
#      YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
#      COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
#      OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
#      ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
#  
# 8. TERMINATION.
#  
#      8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
#      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
#      such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
#      sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
#      survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
#      nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
#      shall survive.
#  
#      8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
#      claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
#      or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
#      You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
#  
#      (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
#      infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
#      Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
#      shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
#      unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
#      agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
#      royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
#      Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
#      the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
#      of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
#      mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
#      is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
#      Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
#      the 60 day notice period specified above.
#  
#      (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
#      Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
#      any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
#      and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
#      sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
#      Participant.
#  
#      8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
#      alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
#      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
#      by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
#      infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
#      granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
#      into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
#      license.
#  
#      8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
#      all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
#      which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
#      prior to termination shall survive termination.
#  
# 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
#  
#      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
#      (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
#      DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
#      OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
#      ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
#      CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
#      WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
#      COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
#      INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
#      LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
#      RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
#      PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
#      EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
#      THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
#  
# 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
#  
#      The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
#      48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
#      software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
#      terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
#      C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
#      all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
#      rights set forth herein.
#  
# 11. MISCELLANEOUS.
#  
#      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
#      matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
#      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
#      necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
#      California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
#      any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
#      With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
#      or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
#      States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
#      subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
#      District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
#      California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
#      without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
#      expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
#      Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
#      Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
#      shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
#      License.
#  
# 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
#  
#      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
#      responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
#      out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
#      work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
#      responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
#      shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
#  
# 13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
#  
#      Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
#      "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
#      Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
#      Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
#      by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

# NOTICE OF RESTRICTED RIGHTS
# "Programs delivered subject to the DOD FAR Supplement are 'commercial computer software' and use, duplication, and disclosure of the programs, including documentation, shall be subject to the licensing restrictions set forth in the applicable Oracle license agreement. Otherwise, programs delivered subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations are 'restricted computer software' and use, duplication, and disclosure of the programs, including documentation, shall be subject to the restrictions in FAR 52.227-19, Commercial Computer Software-Restricted Rights (June 1987). Oracle USA, Inc., 500 Oracle Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065."
#  
# End of Agreement
# You may terminate this agreement by destroying all copies of the programs. We have the right to terminate your right to use the programs if you fail to comply with any of the terms of this agreement, in which case you shall destroy all copies of the programs.
#  
# Relationship Between the Parties
# The relationship between you and us is that of licensee/licensor. Neither party will represent that it has any authority to assume or create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other party, nor to represent the other party as agent, employee, franchisee, or in any other capacity. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to limit either party's right to independently develop or distribute software that is functionally similar to the other party's products, so long as proprietary information of the other party is not included in such software.
#  
# Open Source
# "Open Source" software - software available without charge for use, modification and distribution - is often licensed under terms that require the user to make the user's modifications to the Open Source software or any software that the user 'combines' with the Open Source software freely available in source code form. If you use Open Source software in conjunction with the programs, you must ensure that your use does not: (i) create, or purport to create, obligations of us with respect to the Oracle programs; or (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights to or immunities under our intellectual property or proprietary rights in the Oracle programs. For example, you may not develop a software program using an Oracle program and an Open Source program where such use results in a program file(s) that contains code from both the Oracle program and the Open Source program (including without limitation libraries) if the Open Source program is licensed under a license that requires any "modifications" be made freely available. You also may not combine the Oracle program with programs licensed under the GNU General Public License ("GPL") in any manner that could cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, the Oracle program or any modifications thereto to become subject to the terms of the GPL.
#  
# Entire Agreement
# You agree that this agreement is the complete agreement for the programs and licenses, and this agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations. If any term of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain effective.

# fees paid.
# 
# 2.2. "Product" shall mean the computer programs, that are provided by

# be included in executable form.
# 
#

# not publish, present or document the application programming interface
# (API) of the Software Program except as required for specific use
# within the Product.
# 
# A copy of this license must be distributed in full with the Product in

# 
# Section 4 - Copyright and Trademark
# 
# Licensee acknowledges that all copyrights in the Software Program and

# 
# 5.1 Scope and Duration
# TSI Maintenance Services ("TSIMS") are provided on an annual basis for
# certain TSI Software. The initial order for TSIMS shall be included in
# the initial fees paid for the license.  After the first year of TSIMS
# and for the remainder of the Term, Licensee shall automatically
# receive TSIMS for successive one (1) year periods at the rates for
# such Maintenance Services. TSI shall provide Licensee with notice of
# such renewal, via invoice, at least thirty (30) days prior to such
# renewal date, and Licensee may elect to discontinue TSIMS by written
# notification delivered to TSI prior to such renewal date.
#

# cases that have been opened by Licensee with TSI.
# 
# 
# Section 6 - Warranty and Limited Liability
# 
# Software Warranty: TSI warrants that, for a period of ninety (90) days
# from the initial delivery of the software to Licensee, the Software,
# if used by Licensee in accordance with the Documentation, shall
# operate in material conformity with the Documentation for such
# Software. TSI does not warrant that the Software will meet all of
# Licensee requirements or that the use of the Software will be
# uninterrupted or error free. TSI's entire liability, and Licensee
# exclusive remedy, under this limited Software Warranty shall be for
# TSI (i) to attempt, through reasonable efforts, to correct any
# reproducible material nonconformity discovered within the ninety (90)
# day warranty period; or (ii) to replace the nonconforming Software
# with Software which conforms to the foregoing warranty. In the event
# TSI is unable to cure the breach of warranty described in this
# Section 6, after attempting the remedies described in (i) and (ii)
# above, Licensee may return the Software and TSI shall refund any
# license and maintenance fees paid by Licensee to TSI for the Software.
# The above remedies are available only if TSI is promptly notified in
# writing, within the warranty period, upon discovery of the
# nonconformity by Licensee and TSI's examination of the Software
# discloses that such nonconformity exists, and that the Software has
# not been (i) altered or modified, other than by TSI, (ii) subjected to
# negligence, or computer or electrical malfunctions, or (iii) used,
# adjusted, or installed other than in accordance with the
# Documentation.  Maintenance Services and Other Services Warranty: TSI
# warrants that any Maintenance Services or other Services performed
# pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be performed in a
# professional and workmanlike manner consistent with generally accepted
# industry standards. TSI's entire liability and Licensee exclusive
# remedy under this limited Maintenance Services and Other Services
# Warranty shall be for Licensee to recover the fees paid for such
# nonconforming services
# 
# Disclaimer: THE EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTIES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE
# EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR
# STATUTORY WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, AND TSI EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS
# ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
# MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
# 
# Limitation of Liability: EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS MADE UNDER SECTION 7
# (INDEMNIFICATION), IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S LIABILITY
# ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT
# EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID OR DUE TO TSI HEREUNDER. IN NO EVENT SHALL
# EITHER PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR
# CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR
# LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE
# GOODS OR SERVICES, ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT UNDER ANY
# CAUSE OF ACTION, WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
# THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY
# NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED
# REMEDY.
# 
# Warranty Claims: Any claims made by Licensee for the breach of a
# warranty set forth in this Section 6, shall be made in writing and
# delivered in writing to TSI, and Licensee shall provide TSI a
# reproducible test case, if applicable, demonstrating the breach of
# warranty.
# 
# 
# Section 7 - Indemnification
# 
# TSI warrants that the use or distribution of unaltered Software
# Program(s), or the exercise of the licenses granted hereunder, will
# not infringe any copyright or patent, or other intellectual property
# rights of any third party, and TSI has all rights necessary for the
# grant of the rights and licenses granted by this Agreement. TSI agrees
# to indemnify, defend and hold Licensee harmless from any and all
# actions, causes of action, claims, demands, reasonable costs,
# liabilities, reasonable expenses (including attorney's fees) and
# damages (collectively, a "Loss" or "Losses") arising from any claim
# that the Software Program infringes any copyright or patent, or other
# intellectual property right of a third party, provided, however:
# (1) Licensee shall promptly deliver to TSI notice in writing of any
#     claim for recovery under this section, and, if known, specify in
#     reasonable detail the nature of the Loss and the amount, or an
#     estimate of the amount, of the liability arising there-from.
#     Licensee shall, at TSI's expense, provide to TSI as promptly as
#     practicable thereafter information and documentation reasonably
#     requested by TSI to support and verify the claim assert-ed,
#     provided that, in so doing, it may restrict or condition any
#     disclosure in the interest of preserving privileges of importance
#     in any foreseeable litigation.
# (2) If the facts pertaining to the Loss arise out of the claim of a
#     third party, or if there is any claim against a third party
#     available by virtue of the circumstances of the Loss, TSI shall
#     assume the defense or the prosecution thereof, including the
#     employment of counsel or accountants, at its cost and expense.
#     Licensee shall have the right to employ counsel separate from
#     counsel employed by TSI in any such action and to participate
#     therein, but the fees and expenses of such counsel employed by
#     Licensee shall be at Licensee expense.  TSI shall have the right
#     to determine and adopt (or, in the case of a proposal by Licensee,
#     to approve) a settlement of such matter in its reasonable
#     discretion. TSI shall not be liable for any settlement of any
#     claim effected without its prior written consent, which shall not
#     be unreasonably withheld.  Whether or not TSI chooses to so
#     defend or prosecute such claim, Licensee and TSI shall cooperate
#     in the defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such
#     records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences,
#     discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be
#     reasonably requested in connection therewith.
# (3) If such a claim arises, or in either party's judgment is likely
#     to arise, Licensee agree to allow TSI, at TSI's option, to either
#     (i) procure the right to permit the continued exercise of the
#     rights and licenses in the Software Program granted under this
#     Agreement; (ii) replace or modify the Software Program so it
#     be-comes non-infringing, while affording equivalent performance;
#     or (iii) as its sole obligation, terminate the license for the
#     infringing Software Program and upon return thereof by Licensee,
#     refund the unearned portion of any license fees paid by Licensee
#     for the remainder of the current term hereof.
# (4) TSI shall have no indemnity obligation for claims of infringement
#     resulting from any combination, operation or use of the Software
#     Program, or any components thereof, with any software programs or
#     data not supplied by TSI if such infringement would have been
#     avoided by use of the Software Program alone. Licensee
#     acknowledges and agrees that these four items are the exclusive
#     remedy of Licensee for damages for breach of warranty or
#     representations contained in this Section 7.
# 
# 
# Section 8 - Termination
# 
# Should either party commit a material breach of its obligations
# hereunder, the other party may, at its option, terminate this
# Agreement by written notice to the party in default. Such notice
# shall identify and describe the default upon which termination is
# based. The defaulting party shall have thirty (30) days from the
# effective delivery of the notice to cure such default, which, if
# effected, shall prevent termination by virtue of such default.  Upon
# termination of this Agreement, Licensee will either return to TSI or
# destroy all copies of the Software Program and documentation then in
# your possession.  Licenses to the Software Program granted in the
# normal course of business by Licensee to your customers shall survive
# termination of this Agreement.  Licensee shall, within thirty (30)
# days after the date of such termination furnish TSI with a certificate
# of compliance in accordance with this Section.  The parties agree that
# TSI shall have the right to enforce the obligations arising under this
# Section by seeking specific performance and to enjoin or compel
# Licensee through injunctive relief. Licensee may retain a commercially
# reasonable number of copies of the Software Program and documentation
# solely for the purpose of supporting Licensee customers.
# 
# 
# Section 9 - Export Controls
# 
# Licensee shall comply with, and request of and/or notify Licensee
# sublicensees and resellers that they comply with, all applicable laws,
# regulations, rulings and executive orders of Japan relating to the
# export and re-export of Products containing the Software Program.
# Licensee shall not directly or indirectly export or re-export any
# Products containing the Software Program unless Licensee have obtained
# a license to do so if such a license is required.
# 
# 
# Section 10 - Entire Agreement
# 
# This Agreement, including any attachments, constitutes the entire
# agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
# and supersedes all prior agreements, both oral and written,
# representations, statements, negotiations and undertakings, with
# respect to the subject matter hereof, which such agreements,
# representations, statements, negotiations and undertakings are merged
# herein.  No amendment or modification of this Agreement or any
# provision or attachment of this Agreement shall be effective unless
# it is in writing and signed by both parties.
# 
# 
# Section 11 - Governing Law
# 
# The validity, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be
# governed by the substantive laws of Japan (excluding conflicts of law
# principles).  Each party hereto expressly consents to the personal
# jurisdiction of, and venue in, such courts. If any legal action is
# undertaken to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing
# party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs in
# addition to any other relief to which that party may be entitled.
# 
# 
# Section 12 - Assignment and Benefit
# 
# Without the consent of the other party in writing, neither party may
# assign this Agreement; provided, however, TSI or Licensee may assign
# this Agreement to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the respective
# corporation or a corporation in which the shareholders of the
# respective corporation own a majority interest of the voting control
# provided that the assigning party remains obligated hereunder;
# further provided, however, TSI or Licensee may assign this Agreement
# to another corporation which acquires or has acquired substantially
# all of the stock or assets of the assignor so long as, if the assignor
# is Licensee, the assignee's license to use the Software Program is
# limited to use in Products which were offered by Licensee to Licensee
# customers or potential customers and the assignee is prohibited from
# use of the Software Program in other products or parts of products
# developed, sold or distributed by the assignee.
# 
# This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of
# Licensee and TSI and each party's successors, subject to the other
# provisions of this Section.

# RED HATÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¢??ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® ENTERPRISE LINUXÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¢??ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® VERSION 4
# 
# This agreement governs the use of the Software and any updates to the
# Software, regardless of the delivery mechanism.  The Software is a
# collective work under U.S. Copyright Law.  Subject to the following
# terms, Red Hat, Inc. (?Red Hat?) grants to the user (?Customer?) a
# license to this collective work pursuant to the GNU General Public
# License.
# 
# 1.  The Software.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux (the ?Software?) is a
#     modular operating system consisting of hundreds of software
#     components.  The end user license agreement for each component is
#     located in the component's source code.  With the exception of
#     certain image files identified in Section 2 below, the license
#     terms for the components permit Customer to copy, modify, and
#     redistribute the component, in both source code and binary code
#     forms.  This agreement does not limit Customer's rights under, or
#     grant Customer rights that supersede, the license terms of any
#     particular component.
# 
# 2.  Intellectual Property Rights.  The Software and each of its
#     components, including the source code, documentation, appearance,
#     structure and organization are owned by Red Hat and others and are
#     protected under copyright and other laws.  Title to the Software
#     and any component, or to any copy, modification, or merged portion
#     shall remain with the aforementioned, subject to the applicable
#     license.  The ?Red Hat? trademark and the ?Shadowman? logo are
#     registered trademarks of Red Hat in the U.S. and other countries.
#     This agreement does not permit Customer to distribute the Software
#     using Red Hat's trademarks.  Customer should read the information
#     found at http://www.redhat.com/about/corporate/trademark/ before
#     distributing a copy of the Software, regardless of whether it has
#     been modified.  If Customer makes a commercial redistribution of
#     the Software, unless a separate agreement with Red Hat is executed
#     or other permission granted, then Customer must modify the files
#     identified as ?REDHAT-LOGOS? and ?anaconda-images? to remove all
#     images containing the ?Red Hat? trademark or the ?Shadowman? logo.
#     Merely deleting these files may corrupt the Software.
# 
# 3.  Limited Warranty.  Except as specifically stated in this agreement
#     or a license for a particular component, to the maximum extent
#     permitted under applicable law, the Software and the components
#     are provided and licensed ?as is? without warranty of any kind,
#     expressed or implied, including the implied warranties of
#     merchantability, non-infringement or fitness for a particular
#     purpose.  Red Hat does not warrant that the functions contained in
#     the Software will meet Customer's requirements or that the
#     operation of the Software will be entirely error free or appear
#     precisely as described in the accompanying documentation. This
#     warranty extends only to the party that purchases the Software
#     from Red Hat or a Red Hat authorized distributor.
# 
# 4.  Limitation of Remedies and Liability. To the maximum extent
#     permitted by applicable law, the remedies described below are
#     accepted by Customer as its only remedies.  Red Hat's entire
#     liability, and Customer's exclusive remedies, shall be: If the
#     Software media is defective, Customer may return it within 30 days
#     of delivery along with a copy of Customer's payment receipt and
#     Red Hat, at its option, will replace it or refund the money paid
#     by Customer for the Software.  To the maximum extent permitted by
#     applicable law, Red Hat or any Red Hat authorized dealer will not
#     be liable to Customer for any incidental or consequential damages,
#     including lost profits or lost savings arising out of the use or
#     inability to use the Software, even if Red Hat or such dealer has
#     been advised of the possibility of such damages.  In no event
#     shall Red Hat's liability under this agreement exceed the amount
#     that Customer paid to Red Hat under this agreement during the
#     twelve months preceding the action.
# 
# 5.  Export Control.  As required by U.S. law, Customer represents and
#     warrants that it: (a) understands that the Software is subject to
#     export controls under the U.S. Commerce Department?s Export
#     Administration Regulations (?EAR?); (b) is not located in a

# LICENSE AGREEMENT
# RED HATÃƒÆ’??ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® ENTERPRISE LINUXÃƒÆ’??ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®
# AND RED HATÃƒÆ’??ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® APPLICATIONS
# This end user license agreement ("EULA") governs the use of any of the versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, any Red Hat Applications (as set forth at www.redhat.com/licenses/products), and any related updates, source code, appearance, structure and organization (the "Programs"), regardless of the delivery mechanism.
# 1. License Grant. Subject to the following terms, Red Hat, Inc. ("Red Hat") grants to you ("User") a perpetual, worldwide license to the Programs pursuant to the GNU General Public License v.2. The Programs are either a modular operating system or an application consisting of hundreds of software components. With the exception of certain image files identified in Section 2 below, the license agreement for each software component is located in the software component's source code and permits User to run, copy, modify, and redistribute (subject to certain obligations in some cases) the software component, in both source code and binary code forms. This EULA pertains solely to the Programs and does not limit User's rights under, or grant User rights that supersede, the license terms of any particular component.
# 2. Intellectual Property Rights. The Programs and each of their components are owned by Red Hat and others and are protected under copyright law and under other laws as applicable. Title to the Programs and any component, or to any copy, modification, or merged portion shall remain with the aforementioned, subject to the applicable license. The "Red Hat" trademark and the "Shadowman" logo are registered trademarks of Red Hat in the U.S. and other countries. This EULA does not permit User to distribute the Programs or their components using Red Hat's trademarks, regardless of whether the copy has been modified. User should read the information found at http://www.redhat.com/about/corporate/trademark/ before distributing a copy of the Programs. User may make a commercial redistribution of the Programs only if, (a) a separate agreement with Red Hat authorizing such commercial redistribution is executed or other written permission is granted by Red Hat or (b) User modifies any files identified as "REDHAT-LOGOS" to remove and replace all images containing the "Red Hat" trademark or the "Shadowman" logo. Merely deleting these files may corrupt the Programs.
# 3. Limited Warranty. Except as specifically stated in this Section 3, a separate agreement with Red Hat, or a license for a particular component, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Programs and the components are provided and licensed "as is" without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement or fitness for a particular purpose. Red Hat warrants that the media on which the Programs and the components are furnished will be free from defects in materials and manufacture under normal use for a period of 30 days from the date of delivery to User. Red Hat does not warrant that the functions contained in the Programs will meet User's requirements or that the operation of the Programs will be entirely error free, appear precisely as described in the accompanying documentation, or comply with regulatory requirements. This warranty extends only to the party that purchases services pertaining to the Programs from Red Hat or a Red Hat authorized distributor. 
# 4. Limitation of Remedies and Liability. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, User's exclusive remedy under this EULA is to return any defective media within 30 days of delivery along with a copy of User's payment receipt and Red Hat, at its option, will replace it or refund the money paid by User for the media. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, neither Red Hat, any Red Hat authorized distributor, nor the licensor of any component provided to User under this EULA will be liable to User for any incidental or consequential damages, including lost profits or lost savings arising out of the use or inability to use the Programs or any component, even if Red Hat, such authorized distributor or licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall Red Hat's liability, an authorized distributor's liability or the liability of the licensor of a component provided to User under this EULA exceed the amount that User paid to Red Hat under this EULA during the twelve months preceding the action.
# 5. Export Control. As required by the laws of the United States and other countries, User represents and warrants that it: (a) understands that the Programs and their components may be subject to export controls under the U.S. Commerce Department's Export Administration Regulations ("EAR"); (b) is not located in a prohibited destination country under the EAR or U.S. sanctions regulations (currently Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Sudan and Syria, subject to change as posted by the United States government); (c) will not export, re-export, or transfer the Programs to any prohibited destination or persons or entities on the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security Denied Parties List or Entity List, or the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, or any similar lists maintained by other countries, without the necessary export license(s) or authorizations(s); (d) will not use or transfer the Programs for use in connection with any nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, missile technology, or military end-uses where prohibited by an applicable arms embargo, unless authorized by the relevant government agency by regulation or specific license; (e) understands and agrees that if it is in the United States and exports or transfers the Programs to eligible end users, it will, to the extent required by EAR Section 740.17(e), submit semi-annual reports to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, which include the name and address (including country) of each transferee; and (f) understands that countries including the United States may restrict the import, use, or export of encryption products (which may include the Programs and the components) and agrees that it shall be solely responsible for compliance with any such import, use, or export restrictions.
# 6. Third Party Programs. Red Hat may distribute third party software programs with the Programs that are not part of the Programs. These third party programs are not required to run the Programs, are provided as a convenience to User, and are subject to their own license terms. The license terms either accompany the third party software programs or can be viewed at http://www.redhat.com/licenses/thirdparty/eula.html. If User does not agree to abide by the applicable license terms for the third party software programs, then User may not install them. If User wishes to install the third party software programs on more than one system or transfer the third party software programs to another party, then User must contact the licensor of the applicable third party software programs.
# 7. General. If any provision of this agreement is held to be unenforceable, that shall not affect the enforceability of the remaining provisions. This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York and of the United States, without regard to any conflict of laws provisions. The rights and obligations of the parties to this EULA shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.
