# 
# 安裝及使用產品前，請詳細閱讀下列與使用產品相關的條款與條件。台端在本合約將被稱為「貴用戶」或「使用人」。
# 
# 於以下鍵入 "accept" (接受) 後，表示貴用戶已同意以下事項： 
# 
# (I) 貴用戶已成年，具完全法定能力，可適當約束自我及雇主之行為以遵循本合約之條款； 
# (II) 貴用戶本身及/或以貴用戶雇主之授權代表身分，受本合約之約束。
# 
# 於以下鍵入 "reject" (拒絕) 後，安裝程序將終止。
# 
# 1.  CA, Inc. 或以下第 15 條之後所個別列出認可販售本產品之國家地區的 CA 實體 (以下稱為「CA」) 為使用人提供一 (1) 套產品供其依照以下條件使用：任何訂購單 (定義如下) 或產品包裝盒中的 CD 外盒上授權使用限制 (以下稱為「授權使用限制」) 所載明的 (a) 數量和 (b) CA 用來量測產品使用情形 (包括但不限於 MIPS、CPU、階層、伺服器或使用者) 的發佈準則。CA 以限制、非獨佔、不可轉讓為原則，將產品授權給使用人在「期限」內僅用於內部業務用途，另外也依據以下其他條款與條件：(a) 任何經使用人與 CA 附屬公司簽署或簽約之 CA 訂購單或註冊表格；或 (b) 任何由 CA 視需要提供給使用人之授權程式憑證，參照並納入本合約 (以下稱為「訂購單」) 的條款。
# 
# 2.  如果產品為目前尚未正式發行之 alpha 版或試用版程式 (在下文中稱為「試用版程式」或「試用版軟體」)，CA 不保證正式版本與試用版程式完全相同，亦不保證貴用戶不須重新安裝正式版本。使用人同意若註冊支援服務或經 CA 要求而註冊該服務，使用人應提供 CA 關於使用人對產品操作經驗之特定資訊。使用人同意並承認下列事項：(a) 產品試用版僅適用於測試，不做為任何生產用途，經 CA 書面同意者不在此限；以及 (b) 產品試用版未經測試或偵錯，純粹做為實驗用途，其文件僅供參考，且多有不完整之處。使用人同意 CA 不保證產品試用版之完整性、正確性或使用人之使用或操作。試用版產品係以「原有形式」提供，不提供任何明示或默示之承諾或擔保，其包含但不限於對於產品之所有權或未侵權之任何承諾或擔保。如果使用人同時為試用版產品的測試人員 (依照使用人在取得試用版產品前於註冊程序中同意之試用版測試或發行前版本測試合約 (以下稱為「試用版測試合約」) 所定義)，使用人同意本授權合約之條款為「試用版測試合約」之附加內容，而非使取代該合約。
# 
# 3.  若產品獲授權為試用或評估之用，使用人同意產品僅用於評估，並在 30 天 (除非另外註明期限) 的評估期 (以下稱為「試用期」) 中確實遵守第 1 條之使用限制。試用期結束後，使用人之產品使用權自動失效，使用人同意解除安裝產品，並將全部或部份產品歸還 CA，或以書面方式向 CA 證明已從使用人電腦資料庫及/或儲存裝置中刪除與銷毀全部或部份產品。若使用人希望在試用期滿後繼續延伸其產品使用權，使用人可與 CA 或 CA 附屬公司聯繫並支付費用以取得產品之授權。使用人在試用期間僅以「原有形式」使用產品，不具任何瑕疵責任擔保，CA 亦不負責全部瑕疵責任擔保，包括但不限於適售性之默示擔保及特定用途之適用性，亦不負責本合約他處明示之任何瑕疵責任擔保。
# 
# 4.  如果產品包含軟體開發套件 (以下稱為「SDK」)，本段之條款與條件僅適用於 SDK 的使用層面。SDK 可能包括軟體、API 和相關文件。SDK 僅供使用人內部使用，以開發整合產品與協力廠商軟硬體之軟體，或開發與產品共同使用之軟體 (例如代理程式)。使用人對 SDK 之使用僅限於幫助產品的內部使用。使用人不具有任何關於產品之散發權利。除了下述第 8 條中提及之使用限制之外，使用人不得複製、揭露、銷售，或將 SDK 或文件，或任何含有 SDK 可執行版之應用程式散佈給第三方，亦不得置於網際網路，或在超過授權使用限制所規定的範圍外，使用上述可執行程式。本條款與本合約中其他條款有所衝突時，以本條款中關於 SDK 之使用方面之條款為優先採用。
# 
# 在適用法律的最大許可下，即使與此處條文內容有任何違背之處， SDK 係以「原有形式」加以提供與授權，不具瑕疵擔保責任。
# 
# 5.  支付訂購單中所載明或使用人與 CA 或任何 CA 附屬公司授權經銷商之間所協議之費用，可使使用人具有在訂購單載明之期限 (以下稱為「期限」) 內使用產品之權利，其中可能包括在訂購單所示期限內接受維護服務之權利。全部費用均須依訂購單中的指定支付，或若未指定，則應於 CA 發票日起淨三十 (30) 天內支付。使用人將可安裝產品的每一個新版本。最初期限結束後，使用人須支付訂購單載明之費用，始得繼續使用產品及/或維護服務。如果貴用戶是從 CA 授權經銷商取得產品授權，則本合約中管理付款、定價和折扣的條款將不適用，因為此等條款是貴用戶與所選 CA 經銷商之間的協定。針對可能出現在使用人採購單 (包括但不限於預印條款)，或出現為使用人與 CA 授權經銷商訂單的一部份，但與本合約之條款與條件相牴觸或有所差異的任何條款，將不適用於本產品且應視為無效。  關於任何內容需要持續更新的產品 (例如簽名檔和安全性更新)，使用人可在授權生效日期起算一 (1) 年內享有此類內容更新，不受上述規定之限制。
# 
# 6.  如係由 CA 或 CA 附屬公司提供維護，則需依據所簽訂之訂購單所示，每年重新續約。全部費用均不含稅。使用人同意在收到 CA 或 CA 附屬公司 (若適用) 發出之發票後，支付政府徵收或公家機關代收之任何關稅或稅金，包含但不限於聯邦稅、州稅與地方稅、營業稅、使用稅、加值稅及個人財產稅 (不包含 CA 應付之加盟及所得稅)。上述關稅或稅金之免稅聲明須提供 CA 相關文件證明。使用人逾期未償付之發票，每月衍生之利息至少 1.5%，至多則依照聯邦法定利率。
# 
# 7.  使用人可以在訂購單中指定的授權地區安裝與部署本產品，數量上限依授權使用限制所規定。使用人可以同意其授權使用者在任何地方針對使用人及其附屬公司的內部業務用途存取本產品，前提是使用人在此明確同意授權使用者的違反行為應視為是使用人的違反行為和責任。經事先書面通知之後，使用人得將本產品的使用地點改到訂購單中指定之授權地區內的新使用人地點。在這份文件中，「授權使用者」是指使用人、其附屬公司和所屬員工，以及所應遵守的條款與條件的限制程度不下於本文的條款與條件，並代表使用人而非第三方行為的獨立承包商 (但任何外包商、設備管理供應商、委外服務供應商或應用程式服務供應商除外)；使用人相關「附屬公司」是指使用人直接或間接控制的任何法律實體；而「控制」是指擁有或控制大於 50% 實體股份，或依法律效力或合約 (或相等實力) 控制此等實體的董事會。若使用人欲在上述限制之外使用產品，須告知 CA 或 CA 附屬公司，使用人採購本產品的來源並開立發票及支付延伸使用之費用。
# 
# 8.  產品 (包括任何可能提供給使用人之來源或目的碼) 以及文件、外觀、結構和組織，均為 CA 及/或其授權人之專利財產，並可能受到著作權、專利、註冊商標、商標、商業機密及/或其他法律之保護。SDK 產品所有權或其任何複製、修改、轉譯、部分複製、組譯、衍生物件或合併之程式歸 CA 及/或其授權人所有。 使用人同意 CA 在無需獲得使用人同意的情況下，使用由其所提供且與本產品相關的任何意見反應，作為任何 CA 商業用途使用，包括以此等意見反應為依據的衍生作品重製與準備，以及此等衍生作品的散佈。產品之相關使用權不得替換為其它任何 CA 產品。產品僅做為單一產品進行授權。其組件不得分開單獨使用。貴用戶與其授權使用者須將產品及本授權之條款視為極機密，極力避免產品遭受未經授權的公開和使用。貴用戶不得 (i) 揭露、反組譯或分解產品，亦不得進行產品之還原工程，但若準據法律明文禁止上述限制者，則不在此限；(ii) 建立任何產品之衍生物件；(iii) 將產品用於提供設備管理、外包、服務機構、裝載服務、雲端服務、隨選服務，或在使用人沒有授權此等目的之 CA 授權的情況下，操作或將本產品用於第三方以牟利的類似活動；或 (iv) 准許任何第三方使用本產品，已由 CA 書面授權者除外。使用人未獲 CA 書面同意前，不得向任何第三方揭露產品之任何基準測試結果。使用人不得轉送、讓渡、出租、使用、複製或修改全部或部份產品，或在未獲 CA 書面同意下准許他人對產品進行以上各項行為，但若準據法律明文禁止為上述限制者，則不在此限。使用人不得移除 CA 或其授權人之任何所有權標記。使用人可以針對災難復原「冷待命」、備份及封存等目的，製作合理數量的本產品副本；前提是此類副本的使用僅限於測試使用人的災難復原程序和效率，且必要時僅限實際災難發生之後，使用人無法操作本產品的任何合理期間。若此授權因任何原因而終止，使用人應向 CA 提出書面證明，證明全部或部份產品已從全部電腦及儲存裝置中刪除，並已歸還 CA 或銷毀，將不再使用。使用人同意本產品受歐洲和美國法律約束，包括「出口管理規則 (Export Administration Regulations)」(15 CFR 730-774)，並同意遵守所有適用之進出口法律和規定。使用人同意不會在違反美國法律的情況下出口、再出口或傳輸本產品，或將本產品用於任何化學、生化或核子武器或飛彈應用等相關目的，若使用人瞭解或有原因知道計劃或有可能將本產品用於此等目的，也不會傳輸或轉售本產品。本產品及相關文件係完全由私人開發完成，並屬於美國聯邦採購法規 (Federal Acquisition Regulation，FAR) 分篇 2.101 「定義」中所定義的「商業產品」和「商業電腦軟體」。本產品得不依資訊公開法 (FOIA) 5 U.S.C. 之規定向大眾提供。§552(b) 在該法令的一或多項豁免下 (或類似的美國州法，若適用)。任何先前提供給貴用戶的產品可能無法重複提供。在 CA 收到可接受訂單之後，任何先前未提供給使用人的產品將提供給使用人或其選定的經銷商。本產品應以電子交付形式 (“ESD”) 交貨，或如果 CA 或 CA 附屬公司分別要求從 CA 或此等 CA 附屬公司的出貨點，以有形媒體、CPT (如 INCOTERMS 2010 中所定義) 的形式交貨。使用人採購本產品的 CA 或 CA 附屬公司同意負責所有的關稅和結關，且任何 CA 硬體 (若包含) 的所有權會在 CA 或此等 CA 附屬公司的出貨地點，於交貨時間點轉讓給貨運業者。若是採用電子交付，將不會提供有形的個人所有物。此類電子交付形式可能無法自動提供適用稅額或使用稅之免除。認定為「泛型」或「GA」的任何作業系統表示 CA 按照 CA 目前發佈的規格向大眾提供的本產品，適用於此等作業系統。在最早的實體運輸點或電子形式交貨時授權碼/使用程式碼的傳遞即視為完成交貨。CA Inc. 是本產品的製造商。CA 保留在通知貴用戶後遠端或駐站稽核使用人和 (或) 其附屬公司設施的權利，以查證使用人及其授權使用者是否遵循本合約條款。CA 同意應在貴用戶辦公室的正常工作時間內進行此等稽核，且 CA 在進行此等稽核時，應盡力避免以不合理的方式干擾貴用戶的活動，和 (或) 視需要使用受保密條款約束的獨立第三方進行稽核。本合約應遵守美國法律，並依據美國法律作出解釋，不必顧及其選擇的法律規定，且任何與本合約內容或相關的行動都必須以紐約蘇福克郡的聯邦上訴法院的專屬管轄權為準。
# 
# 9. CA 保證簽署本合約，並保證賠償或選擇解決 CA 未經授權、或使用人在經授權情況下使用產品，但侵害任何美國專利或交貨時授權使用人使用本產品之所在司法管轄區著作權的任何第三方的主張。CA 亦保證自產品交付使用人起九十 (90) 天內，其分散式產品會符合其說明文件中所列示之發佈規格運作，前提是 CA 的唯一責任為盡力使產品與業界標準達成一致，以避免任何缺失。在收到使用人針對上述擔保之書面違約通知後合理期限內，若 CA 無法使產品之操作 (a) 符合第三方智慧財產權或 (b) 確實符合 CA 之書面規格，CA 得以終止此授權，並根據授權費用及 (或) 已支付的支援與維護費用，提供或安排按比例退費給使用人或其 CA 授權經銷商。若有此等終止情形，按比例退費應根據 (i) 適用訂購單期限內剩餘的月份數，或 (ii) 如果本產品是以永久授權的方式進行授權，使用 (僅限用於退費計算用途) 三 (3) 年的分期償還計畫表進行計算。本條文中所列示的保固內容並不適用於本產品的測試版、試用版、評估或展示版本，或是軟體開發套件。CA 針對下列情況不具賠償或補償保固聲明的責任：(i) 如果侵權或保固聲明的主張是因為修改產品所致，CA 所做的修改除外，(ii) 如果未遵守 CA 的規格、相關說明文件及指導方針使用本產品，(iii) 如果主張的侵權或保固聲明可因使用 CA 發佈的更新或修補程式而避免或消除，(iv) 如果主張的侵權或保固聲明是因為結合使用本產品與任何第三方產品所致，或 (v) 如果尚未支付應付的產品相關費用，或使用人違反本合約。此處所提及的賠償將不適用，且 CA 不負與 CA 所生產的任何產品在使用人明確指導下有關的責任。上述條款說明 CA 有關侵權聲明的所有責任和義務，以及針對任何實際或主張的侵權或侵佔任何智慧財產權或其他所有權，提供給使用人的專有補救措施。
# 
# 10.  除上述規定外，尚須符合下列法律規定： 
# 
# (I) CA 不提供任何明示或默示之保證，其包括但不限於適售性之默示保證及任何特定用途之適用性； 
# (II) 在任何情況下，對貴用戶或其它任何人因使用、操作或修改產品造成之損失，包括時間、金錢、商譽及衍生性損害或間接損害，即使 CA 曾被告知此等損害之可能性，CA 均無須負責。在上述之責任限制與法律牴觸時，CA 之責任僅限於使用人實際支付之授權費用。包括代理商、經銷商或授權零售商在內之第三方，均無權修改上述擔保，或代表 CA 提供其它擔保。CA 不保證本產品將符合使用人的要求，亦不保證該產品之使用不會中斷或完全沒有錯誤。
# 
# 11.  使用人在同意 CA 所提出與授權合約相關之政策時，包括產品使用範圍不得超出使用人及使用人所屬子公司產業，始簽署本合約。
# 
# 12.  若使用人違反本合約任一條款，或使用人無償付能力，或使用人宣告會被宣告破產或受破產管理人管理，CA 有權據此中斷服務並且/或者立即終止本合約。除 CA 其它所有權利之外，全部應支付或即將支付之費用 (若有的話) 必須立即支付給使用人採購本產品的 CA 或 CA 附屬公司。
# 
# 13.  若使用人未支付維護費用，須支付 CA 或個別 CA 附屬公司相當於 150% 的年度維護費用，始得恢復維護服務。
# 
# 14.  如果法院認為本合約的任何條款為違法、無效或不可執行，剩餘的其它條款仍保有完全效力與效果。任何違反本合約責任的免除不代表對其它違反本合約責任的免除，免除責任將為無效，除非由免除責任一方之授權代表以書面簽署。關於本合約之任何問題，請洽詢 CA, Inc. 全球法律部，地址為 One CA Plaza, Islandia, NY 11749。

#  
# 4.2. Effect of New Versions.
#  
# You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.
#  
# 4.3. Modified Versions.
#  
# When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.
#  
# 5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
#  
# COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN 'AS IS' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
#  
# 6. TERMINATION.
#  
# 6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
#  
# 6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as 'Participant') alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.
#  
# 6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
#  
# 7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
#  
# UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
#  
# 8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
#  
# The Covered Software is a 'commercial item,' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of 'commercial computer software' (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Ã?'Ã?Â§ 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and 'commercial computer software documentation' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.
#  
# 9. MISCELLANEOUS.
#  
# This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
#  
# 10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
#  
# As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

#      The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
#      non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
#      claims:
#           (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
#           trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,
#           modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
#           Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or
#           as part of a Larger Work; and
#  
#           (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or
#           selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice,
#           sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the
#           Original Code (or portions thereof).
#  
#           (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are
#           effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes
#           Original Code under the terms of this License.
#  
#           (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
#           granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)
#           separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused
#           by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the
#           combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.
#  
#      2.2. Contributor Grant.
#      Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor
#      hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license
#  
#           (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
#           trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,
#           display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications
#           created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an
#           unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code
#           and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
#  
#           (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or
#           selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone
#           and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions
#           of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
#           made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that
#           Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of
#           Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
#           Version (or portions of such combination).
#  
#           (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are
#           effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of
#           the Covered Code.
#  
#           (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
#           granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the
#           Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;
#           3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
#           Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made
#           by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the
#           Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
#           infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
#           that Contributor.
#  
# 3. Distribution Obligations.
#  
#      3.1. Application of License.
#      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
#      governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
#      Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
#      distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
#      of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
#      copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
#      distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
#      version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
#      License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
#      an additional document offering the additional rights described in
#      Section 3.5.
#  
#      3.2. Availability of Source Code.
#      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
#      made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
#      either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
#      Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
#      Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
#      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
#      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
#      (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
#      has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
#      ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
#      Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
#  
#      3.3. Description of Modifications.
#      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
#      file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
#      the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
#      the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
#      Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
#      Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
#      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
#      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
#  
#      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
#           (a) Third Party Claims.
#           If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
#           intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
#           granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
#           Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
#           distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
#           party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
#           know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
#           the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
#           Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
#           Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
#           (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
#           reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
#           Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
#  
#           (b) Contributor APIs.
#           If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
#           interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
#           are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
#           also include this information in the LEGAL file.
#  
#                (c)    Representations.
#           Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
#           Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
#           Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
#           Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
#           this License.
#  
#      3.5. Required Notices.
#      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
#      Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
#      Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
#      location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
#      to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
#      You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
#      Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
#      for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
#      rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
#      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
#      obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
#      may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
#      Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
#      any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
#      offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
#      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
#      Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
#      support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
#  
#      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
#      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
#      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
#      and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
#      the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
#      including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
#      obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
#      in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
#      collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
#      Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
#      Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
#      contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
#      compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
#      Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
#      rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
#      License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
#      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
#      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
#      Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
#      Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
#      the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
#      terms You offer.
#  
#      3.7. Larger Works.
#      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
#      not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
#      Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
#      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
#  
# 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
#  
#      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
#      License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
#      statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
#      the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
#      describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
#      must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
#      be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
#      extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
#      sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
#      understand it.
#  
# 5. Application of this License.
#  
#      This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
#      attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
#  
# 6. Versions of the License.
#  
#      6.1. New Versions.
#      Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
#      and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
#      will be given a distinguishing version number.
#  
#      6.2. Effect of New Versions.
#      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
#      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
#      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
#      of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
#      other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
#      Covered Code created under this License.
#  
#      6.3. Derivative Works.
#      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
#      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
#      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
#      the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
#      "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
#      license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
#      and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
#      contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
#      Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
#      Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
#      Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
#      this License.)
#  
# 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
#  
#      COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
#      WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
#      WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
#      DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
#      THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
#      IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
#      YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
#      COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
#      OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
#      ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
#  
# 8. TERMINATION.
#  
#      8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
#      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
#      such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
#      sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
#      survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
#      nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
#      shall survive.
#  
#      8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
#      claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
#      or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
#      You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
#  
#      (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
#      infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
#      Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
#      shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
#      unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
#      agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
#      royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
#      Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
#      the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
#      of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
#      mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
#      is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
#      Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
#      the 60 day notice period specified above.
#  
#      (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
#      Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
#      any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
#      and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
#      sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
#      Participant.
#  
#      8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
#      alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
#      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
#      by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
#      infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
#      granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
#      into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
#      license.
#  
#      8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
#      all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
#      which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
#      prior to termination shall survive termination.
#  
# 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
#  
#      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
#      (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
#      DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
#      OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
#      ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
#      CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
#      WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
#      COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
#      INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
#      LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
#      RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
#      PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
#      EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
#      THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
#  
# 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
#  
#      The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
#      48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
#      software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
#      terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
#      C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
#      all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
#      rights set forth herein.
#  
# 11. MISCELLANEOUS.
#  
#      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
#      matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
#      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
#      necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
#      California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
#      any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
#      With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
#      or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
#      States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
#      subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
#      District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
#      California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
#      without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
#      expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
#      Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
#      Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
#      shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
#      License.
#  
# 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
#  
#      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
#      responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
#      out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
#      work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
#      responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
#      shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
#  
# 13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
#  
#      Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
#      "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
#      Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
#      Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
#      by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

# NOTICE OF RESTRICTED RIGHTS
# "Programs delivered subject to the DOD FAR Supplement are 'commercial computer software' and use, duplication, and disclosure of the programs, including documentation, shall be subject to the licensing restrictions set forth in the applicable Oracle license agreement. Otherwise, programs delivered subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations are 'restricted computer software' and use, duplication, and disclosure of the programs, including documentation, shall be subject to the restrictions in FAR 52.227-19, Commercial Computer Software-Restricted Rights (June 1987). Oracle USA, Inc., 500 Oracle Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065."
#  
# End of Agreement
# You may terminate this agreement by destroying all copies of the programs. We have the right to terminate your right to use the programs if you fail to comply with any of the terms of this agreement, in which case you shall destroy all copies of the programs.
#  
# Relationship Between the Parties
# The relationship between you and us is that of licensee/licensor. Neither party will represent that it has any authority to assume or create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other party, nor to represent the other party as agent, employee, franchisee, or in any other capacity. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to limit either party's right to independently develop or distribute software that is functionally similar to the other party's products, so long as proprietary information of the other party is not included in such software.
#  
# Open Source
# "Open Source" software - software available without charge for use, modification and distribution - is often licensed under terms that require the user to make the user's modifications to the Open Source software or any software that the user 'combines' with the Open Source software freely available in source code form. If you use Open Source software in conjunction with the programs, you must ensure that your use does not: (i) create, or purport to create, obligations of us with respect to the Oracle programs; or (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights to or immunities under our intellectual property or proprietary rights in the Oracle programs. For example, you may not develop a software program using an Oracle program and an Open Source program where such use results in a program file(s) that contains code from both the Oracle program and the Open Source program (including without limitation libraries) if the Open Source program is licensed under a license that requires any "modifications" be made freely available. You also may not combine the Oracle program with programs licensed under the GNU General Public License ("GPL") in any manner that could cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, the Oracle program or any modifications thereto to become subject to the terms of the GPL.
#  
# Entire Agreement
# You agree that this agreement is the complete agreement for the programs and licenses, and this agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations. If any term of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain effective.

# fees paid.
# 
# 2.2. "Product" shall mean the computer programs, that are provided by

# in source form, the Software Program or any of its components may only
# be included in executable form.
# 
# 
# Section 3 - Licensee Obligations
# 
# Licensee shall be solely responsible for all marketing, manufacturing,
# packaging, documentation production, distribution and customer pricing

# contained within the Software Program.  Licensee agree that Licensee
# will not, nor will Licensee authorize or license another to, sell,
# market or license the Software Program, or any portion thereof, as a
# standalone computer software program, component or software
# development tool, or as a component or components of a computer
# software program, the chief marketability and functionality of which
# is the Software Program.  Licensee further agree that Licensee will
# not publish, present or document the application programming interface
# (API) of the Software Program except as required for specific use
# within the Product.
# 
# A copy of this license must be distributed in full with the Product in

# 
# 
# Section 4 - Copyright and Trademark
# 
# Licensee acknowledges that all copyrights in the Software Program and

# 
# 5.1 Scope and Duration
# TSI Maintenance Services ("TSIMS") are provided on an annual basis for
# certain TSI Software. The initial order for TSIMS shall be included in
# the initial fees paid for the license.  After the first year of TSIMS
# and for the remainder of the Term, Licensee shall automatically
# receive TSIMS for successive one (1) year periods at the rates for
# such Maintenance Services. TSI shall provide Licensee with notice of
# such renewal, via invoice, at least thirty (30) days prior to such
# renewal date, and Licensee may elect to discontinue TSIMS by written
# notification delivered to TSI prior to such renewal date.
# 
# 5.2 Maintenance Obligations of the Parties

# (i) appropriate number of trained personnel available to provide, in
# a competent manner, first line support of the Software Program to
# Licensee customers, (ii) log of all communication between Licensee and
# Licensee customer, as well as a reproducible test case (wherever
# possible) and any relevant information for any second line support
# cases that have been opened by Licensee with TSI.
# 
# 
# Section 6 - Warranty and Limited Liability
# 
# Software Warranty: TSI warrants that, for a period of ninety (90) days
# from the initial delivery of the software to Licensee, the Software,
# if used by Licensee in accordance with the Documentation, shall
# operate in material conformity with the Documentation for such
# Software. TSI does not warrant that the Software will meet all of
# Licensee requirements or that the use of the Software will be
# uninterrupted or error free. TSI's entire liability, and Licensee
# exclusive remedy, under this limited Software Warranty shall be for
# TSI (i) to attempt, through reasonable efforts, to correct any
# reproducible material nonconformity discovered within the ninety (90)
# day warranty period; or (ii) to replace the nonconforming Software
# with Software which conforms to the foregoing warranty. In the event
# TSI is unable to cure the breach of warranty described in this
# Section 6, after attempting the remedies described in (i) and (ii)
# above, Licensee may return the Software and TSI shall refund any
# license and maintenance fees paid by Licensee to TSI for the Software.
# The above remedies are available only if TSI is promptly notified in
# writing, within the warranty period, upon discovery of the
# nonconformity by Licensee and TSI's examination of the Software
# discloses that such nonconformity exists, and that the Software has
# not been (i) altered or modified, other than by TSI, (ii) subjected to
# negligence, or computer or electrical malfunctions, or (iii) used,
# adjusted, or installed other than in accordance with the
# Documentation.  Maintenance Services and Other Services Warranty: TSI
# warrants that any Maintenance Services or other Services performed
# pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be performed in a
# professional and workmanlike manner consistent with generally accepted
# industry standards. TSI's entire liability and Licensee exclusive
# remedy under this limited Maintenance Services and Other Services
# Warranty shall be for Licensee to recover the fees paid for such
# nonconforming services
# 
# Disclaimer: THE EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTIES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE
# EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR
# STATUTORY WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, AND TSI EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS
# ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
# MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
# 
# Limitation of Liability: EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS MADE UNDER SECTION 7
# (INDEMNIFICATION), IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S LIABILITY
# ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT
# EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID OR DUE TO TSI HEREUNDER. IN NO EVENT SHALL
# EITHER PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR
# CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR
# LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE
# GOODS OR SERVICES, ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT UNDER ANY
# CAUSE OF ACTION, WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
# THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY
# NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED
# REMEDY.
# 
# Warranty Claims: Any claims made by Licensee for the breach of a
# warranty set forth in this Section 6, shall be made in writing and
# delivered in writing to TSI, and Licensee shall provide TSI a
# reproducible test case, if applicable, demonstrating the breach of
# warranty.
# 
# 
# Section 7 - Indemnification
# 
# TSI warrants that the use or distribution of unaltered Software
# Program(s), or the exercise of the licenses granted hereunder, will
# not infringe any copyright or patent, or other intellectual property
# rights of any third party, and TSI has all rights necessary for the
# grant of the rights and licenses granted by this Agreement. TSI agrees
# to indemnify, defend and hold Licensee harmless from any and all
# actions, causes of action, claims, demands, reasonable costs,
# liabilities, reasonable expenses (including attorney's fees) and
# damages (collectively, a "Loss" or "Losses") arising from any claim
# that the Software Program infringes any copyright or patent, or other
# intellectual property right of a third party, provided, however:
# (1) Licensee shall promptly deliver to TSI notice in writing of any
#     claim for recovery under this section, and, if known, specify in
#     reasonable detail the nature of the Loss and the amount, or an
#     estimate of the amount, of the liability arising there-from.
#     Licensee shall, at TSI's expense, provide to TSI as promptly as
#     practicable thereafter information and documentation reasonably
#     requested by TSI to support and verify the claim assert-ed,
#     provided that, in so doing, it may restrict or condition any
#     disclosure in the interest of preserving privileges of importance
#     in any foreseeable litigation.
# (2) If the facts pertaining to the Loss arise out of the claim of a
#     third party, or if there is any claim against a third party
#     available by virtue of the circumstances of the Loss, TSI shall
#     assume the defense or the prosecution thereof, including the
#     employment of counsel or accountants, at its cost and expense.
#     Licensee shall have the right to employ counsel separate from
#     counsel employed by TSI in any such action and to participate
#     therein, but the fees and expenses of such counsel employed by
#     Licensee shall be at Licensee expense.  TSI shall have the right
#     to determine and adopt (or, in the case of a proposal by Licensee,
#     to approve) a settlement of such matter in its reasonable
#     discretion. TSI shall not be liable for any settlement of any
#     claim effected without its prior written consent, which shall not
#     be unreasonably withheld.  Whether or not TSI chooses to so
#     defend or prosecute such claim, Licensee and TSI shall cooperate
#     in the defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such
#     records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences,
#     discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be
#     reasonably requested in connection therewith.
# (3) If such a claim arises, or in either party's judgment is likely
#     to arise, Licensee agree to allow TSI, at TSI's option, to either
#     (i) procure the right to permit the continued exercise of the
#     rights and licenses in the Software Program granted under this
#     Agreement; (ii) replace or modify the Software Program so it
#     be-comes non-infringing, while affording equivalent performance;
#     or (iii) as its sole obligation, terminate the license for the
#     infringing Software Program and upon return thereof by Licensee,
#     refund the unearned portion of any license fees paid by Licensee
#     for the remainder of the current term hereof.
# (4) TSI shall have no indemnity obligation for claims of infringement
#     resulting from any combination, operation or use of the Software
#     Program, or any components thereof, with any software programs or
#     data not supplied by TSI if such infringement would have been
#     avoided by use of the Software Program alone. Licensee
#     acknowledges and agrees that these four items are the exclusive
#     remedy of Licensee for damages for breach of warranty or
#     representations contained in this Section 7.
# 
# 
# Section 8 - Termination
# 
# Should either party commit a material breach of its obligations
# hereunder, the other party may, at its option, terminate this
# Agreement by written notice to the party in default. Such notice
# shall identify and describe the default upon which termination is
# based. The defaulting party shall have thirty (30) days from the
# effective delivery of the notice to cure such default, which, if
# effected, shall prevent termination by virtue of such default.  Upon
# termination of this Agreement, Licensee will either return to TSI or
# destroy all copies of the Software Program and documentation then in
# your possession.  Licenses to the Software Program granted in the
# normal course of business by Licensee to your customers shall survive
# termination of this Agreement.  Licensee shall, within thirty (30)
# days after the date of such termination furnish TSI with a certificate
# of compliance in accordance with this Section.  The parties agree that
# TSI shall have the right to enforce the obligations arising under this
# Section by seeking specific performance and to enjoin or compel
# Licensee through injunctive relief. Licensee may retain a commercially
# reasonable number of copies of the Software Program and documentation
# solely for the purpose of supporting Licensee customers.
# 
# 
# Section 9 - Export Controls
# 
# Licensee shall comply with, and request of and/or notify Licensee
# sublicensees and resellers that they comply with, all applicable laws,
# regulations, rulings and executive orders of Japan relating to the
# export and re-export of Products containing the Software Program.
# Licensee shall not directly or indirectly export or re-export any
# Products containing the Software Program unless Licensee have obtained
# a license to do so if such a license is required.
# 
# 
# Section 10 - Entire Agreement
# 
# This Agreement, including any attachments, constitutes the entire
# agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
# and supersedes all prior agreements, both oral and written,
# representations, statements, negotiations and undertakings, with
# respect to the subject matter hereof, which such agreements,
# representations, statements, negotiations and undertakings are merged
# herein.  No amendment or modification of this Agreement or any
# provision or attachment of this Agreement shall be effective unless
# it is in writing and signed by both parties.
# 
# 
# Section 11 - Governing Law
# 
# The validity, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be
# governed by the substantive laws of Japan (excluding conflicts of law
# principles).  Each party hereto expressly consents to the personal
# jurisdiction of, and venue in, such courts. If any legal action is
# undertaken to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing
# party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs in
# addition to any other relief to which that party may be entitled.
# 
# 
# Section 12 - Assignment and Benefit
# 
# Without the consent of the other party in writing, neither party may
# assign this Agreement; provided, however, TSI or Licensee may assign
# this Agreement to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the respective
# corporation or a corporation in which the shareholders of the
# respective corporation own a majority interest of the voting control
# provided that the assigning party remains obligated hereunder;
# further provided, however, TSI or Licensee may assign this Agreement
# to another corporation which acquires or has acquired substantially
# all of the stock or assets of the assignor so long as, if the assignor
# is Licensee, the assignee's license to use the Software Program is
# limited to use in Products which were offered by Licensee to Licensee
# customers or potential customers and the assignee is prohibited from
# use of the Software Program in other products or parts of products
# developed, sold or distributed by the assignee.
# 
# This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of
# Licensee and TSI and each party's successors, subject to the other
# provisions of this Section.

# LICENSE AGREEMENT AND LIMITED PRODUCT WARRANTY
# RED HATÃƒ?Ã¢??Ãƒ?Ã‚Â® ENTERPRISE LINUXÃƒ?Ã¢??Ãƒ?Ã‚Â® VERSION 4
# 
# This agreement governs the use of the Software and any updates to the
# Software, regardless of the delivery mechanism.  The Software is a
# collective work under U.S. Copyright Law.  Subject to the following
# terms, Red Hat, Inc. (?Red Hat?) grants to the user (?Customer?) a
# license to this collective work pursuant to the GNU General Public
# License.
# 
# 1.  The Software.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux (the ?Software?) is a
#     modular operating system consisting of hundreds of software
#     components.  The end user license agreement for each component is
#     located in the component's source code.  With the exception of
#     certain image files identified in Section 2 below, the license
#     terms for the components permit Customer to copy, modify, and
#     redistribute the component, in both source code and binary code
#     forms.  This agreement does not limit Customer's rights under, or
#     grant Customer rights that supersede, the license terms of any
#     particular component.
# 
# 2.  Intellectual Property Rights.  The Software and each of its
#     components, including the source code, documentation, appearance,
#     structure and organization are owned by Red Hat and others and are
#     protected under copyright and other laws.  Title to the Software
#     and any component, or to any copy, modification, or merged portion
#     shall remain with the aforementioned, subject to the applicable
#     license.  The ?Red Hat? trademark and the ?Shadowman? logo are
#     registered trademarks of Red Hat in the U.S. and other countries.
#     This agreement does not permit Customer to distribute the Software
#     using Red Hat's trademarks.  Customer should read the information
#     found at http://www.redhat.com/about/corporate/trademark/ before
#     distributing a copy of the Software, regardless of whether it has
#     been modified.  If Customer makes a commercial redistribution of
#     the Software, unless a separate agreement with Red Hat is executed
#     or other permission granted, then Customer must modify the files
#     identified as ?REDHAT-LOGOS? and ?anaconda-images? to remove all
#     images containing the ?Red Hat? trademark or the ?Shadowman? logo.
#     Merely deleting these files may corrupt the Software.
# 
# 3.  Limited Warranty.  Except as specifically stated in this agreement
#     or a license for a particular component, to the maximum extent
#     permitted under applicable law, the Software and the components
#     are provided and licensed ?as is? without warranty of any kind,
#     expressed or implied, including the implied warranties of
#     merchantability, non-infringement or fitness for a particular
#     purpose.  Red Hat does not warrant that the functions contained in
#     the Software will meet Customer's requirements or that the
#     operation of the Software will be entirely error free or appear
#     precisely as described in the accompanying documentation. This
#     warranty extends only to the party that purchases the Software
#     from Red Hat or a Red Hat authorized distributor.
# 
# 4.  Limitation of Remedies and Liability. To the maximum extent
#     permitted by applicable law, the remedies described below are
#     accepted by Customer as its only remedies.  Red Hat's entire
#     liability, and Customer's exclusive remedies, shall be: If the
#     Software media is defective, Customer may return it within 30 days
#     of delivery along with a copy of Customer's payment receipt and
#     Red Hat, at its option, will replace it or refund the money paid
#     by Customer for the Software.  To the maximum extent permitted by
#     applicable law, Red Hat or any Red Hat authorized dealer will not
#     be liable to Customer for any incidental or consequential damages,
#     including lost profits or lost savings arising out of the use or
#     inability to use the Software, even if Red Hat or such dealer has
#     been advised of the possibility of such damages.  In no event
#     shall Red Hat's liability under this agreement exceed the amount
#     that Customer paid to Red Hat under this agreement during the
#     twelve months preceding the action.
# 
# 5.  Export Control.  As required by U.S. law, Customer represents and
#     warrants that it: (a) understands that the Software is subject to
#     export controls under the U.S. Commerce Department?s Export
#     Administration Regulations (?EAR?); (b) is not located in a
#     prohibited destination country under the EAR or U.S. sanctions
#     regulations (currently Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan
#     and Syria); (c) will not export, re-export, or transfer the
#     Software to any prohibited destination, entity, or individual
#     without the necessary export license(s) or authorizations(s) from
#     the U.S. Government; (d) will not use or transfer the Software for
#     use in any sensitive nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, or
#     missile technology end-uses unless authorized by the
#     U.S. Government by regulation or specific license; (e) understands
#     and agrees that if it is in the United States and exports or
#     transfers the Software to eligible end users, it will, as required
#     by EAR Section 741.17(e), submit semi-annual reports to the
#     Commerce Department?s Bureau of Industry & Security (BIS), which
#     include the name and address (including country) of each
#     transferee; and (f) understands that countries other than the
#     United States may restrict the import, use, or export of
#     encryption products and that it shall be solely responsible for
#     compliance with any such import, use, or export restrictions.
# 
# 6.  Third Party Programs. Red Hat may distribute third party software

# LICENSE AGREEMENT
# RED HATÃƒ??Ãƒ?Ã‚Â® ENTERPRISE LINUXÃƒ??Ãƒ?Ã‚Â®
# AND RED HATÃƒ??Ãƒ?Ã‚Â® APPLICATIONS
# This end user license agreement ("EULA") governs the use of any of the versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, any Red Hat Applications (as set forth at www.redhat.com/licenses/products), and any related updates, source code, appearance, structure and organization (the "Programs"), regardless of the delivery mechanism.
# 1. License Grant. Subject to the following terms, Red Hat, Inc. ("Red Hat") grants to you ("User") a perpetual, worldwide license to the Programs pursuant to the GNU General Public License v.2. The Programs are either a modular operating system or an application consisting of hundreds of software components. With the exception of certain image files identified in Section 2 below, the license agreement for each software component is located in the software component's source code and permits User to run, copy, modify, and redistribute (subject to certain obligations in some cases) the software component, in both source code and binary code forms. This EULA pertains solely to the Programs and does not limit User's rights under, or grant User rights that supersede, the license terms of any particular component.
# 2. Intellectual Property Rights. The Programs and each of their components are owned by Red Hat and others and are protected under copyright law and under other laws as applicable. Title to the Programs and any component, or to any copy, modification, or merged portion shall remain with the aforementioned, subject to the applicable license. The "Red Hat" trademark and the "Shadowman" logo are registered trademarks of Red Hat in the U.S. and other countries. This EULA does not permit User to distribute the Programs or their components using Red Hat's trademarks, regardless of whether the copy has been modified. User should read the information found at http://www.redhat.com/about/corporate/trademark/ before distributing a copy of the Programs. User may make a commercial redistribution of the Programs only if, (a) a separate agreement with Red Hat authorizing such commercial redistribution is executed or other written permission is granted by Red Hat or (b) User modifies any files identified as "REDHAT-LOGOS" to remove and replace all images containing the "Red Hat" trademark or the "Shadowman" logo. Merely deleting these files may corrupt the Programs.
# 3. Limited Warranty. Except as specifically stated in this Section 3, a separate agreement with Red Hat, or a license for a particular component, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Programs and the components are provided and licensed "as is" without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement or fitness for a particular purpose. Red Hat warrants that the media on which the Programs and the components are furnished will be free from defects in materials and manufacture under normal use for a period of 30 days from the date of delivery to User. Red Hat does not warrant that the functions contained in the Programs will meet User's requirements or that the operation of the Programs will be entirely error free, appear precisely as described in the accompanying documentation, or comply with regulatory requirements. This warranty extends only to the party that purchases services pertaining to the Programs from Red Hat or a Red Hat authorized distributor. 
# 4. Limitation of Remedies and Liability. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, User's exclusive remedy under this EULA is to return any defective media within 30 days of delivery along with a copy of User's payment receipt and Red Hat, at its option, will replace it or refund the money paid by User for the media. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, neither Red Hat, any Red Hat authorized distributor, nor the licensor of any component provided to User under this EULA will be liable to User for any incidental or consequential damages, including lost profits or lost savings arising out of the use or inability to use the Programs or any component, even if Red Hat, such authorized distributor or licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall Red Hat's liability, an authorized distributor's liability or the liability of the licensor of a component provided to User under this EULA exceed the amount that User paid to Red Hat under this EULA during the twelve months preceding the action.
# 5. Export Control. As required by the laws of the United States and other countries, User represents and warrants that it: (a) understands that the Programs and their components may be subject to export controls under the U.S. Commerce Department's Export Administration Regulations ("EAR"); (b) is not located in a prohibited destination country under the EAR or U.S. sanctions regulations (currently Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Sudan and Syria, subject to change as posted by the United States government); (c) will not export, re-export, or transfer the Programs to any prohibited destination or persons or entities on the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security Denied Parties List or Entity List, or the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, or any similar lists maintained by other countries, without the necessary export license(s) or authorizations(s); (d) will not use or transfer the Programs for use in connection with any nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, missile technology, or military end-uses where prohibited by an applicable arms embargo, unless authorized by the relevant government agency by regulation or specific license; (e) understands and agrees that if it is in the United States and exports or transfers the Programs to eligible end users, it will, to the extent required by EAR Section 740.17(e), submit semi-annual reports to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, which include the name and address (including country) of each transferee; and (f) understands that countries including the United States may restrict the import, use, or export of encryption products (which may include the Programs and the components) and agrees that it shall be solely responsible for compliance with any such import, use, or export restrictions.
# 6. Third Party Programs. Red Hat may distribute third party software programs with the Programs that are not part of the Programs. These third party programs are not required to run the Programs, are provided as a convenience to User, and are subject to their own license terms. The license terms either accompany the third party software programs or can be viewed at http://www.redhat.com/licenses/thirdparty/eula.html. If User does not agree to abide by the applicable license terms for the third party software programs, then User may not install them. If User wishes to install the third party software programs on more than one system or transfer the third party software programs to another party, then User must contact the licensor of the applicable third party software programs.
# 7. General. If any provision of this agreement is held to be unenforceable, that shall not affect the enforceability of the remaining provisions. This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York and of the United States, without regard to any conflict of laws provisions. The rights and obligations of the parties to this EULA shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.
