#           distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
#           party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
#           know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
#           the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
#           Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
#           Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
#           (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
#           reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
#           Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
#  
#           (b) Contributor APIs.
#           If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
#           interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
#           are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
#           also include this information in the LEGAL file.
#  
#                (c)    Representations.
#           Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
#           Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
#           Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
#           Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
#           this License.
#  
#      3.5. Required Notices.
#      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
#      Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
#      Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
#      location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
#      to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
#      You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
#      Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
#      for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
#      rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
#      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
#      obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
#      may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
#      Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
#      any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
#      offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
#      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
#      Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
#      support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
#  
#      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
#      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
#      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
#      and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
#      the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
#      including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
#      obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
#      in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
#      collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
#      Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
#      Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
#      contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
#      compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
#      Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
#      rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
#      License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
#      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
#      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
#      Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
#      Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
#      the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
#      terms You offer.
#  
#      3.7. Larger Works.
#      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
#      not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
#      Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
#      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
#  
# 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
#  
#      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
#      License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
#      statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
#      the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
#      describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
#      must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
#      be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
#      extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
#      sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
#      understand it.
#  
# 5. Application of this License.
#  
#      This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
#      attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
#  
# 6. Versions of the License.
#  
#      6.1. New Versions.
#      Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
#      and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
#      will be given a distinguishing version number.
#  
#      6.2. Effect of New Versions.
#      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
#      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
#      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
#      of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
#      other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
#      Covered Code created under this License.
#  
#      6.3. Derivative Works.
#      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
#      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
#      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
#      the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
#      "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
#      license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
#      and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
#      contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
#      Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
#      Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
#      Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
#      this License.)
#  
# 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
#  
#      COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
#      WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
#      WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
#      DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
#      THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
#      IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
#      YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
#      COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
#      OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
#      ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
#  
# 8. TERMINATION.
#  
#      8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
#      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
#      such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
#      sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
#      survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
#      nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
#      shall survive.
#  
#      8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
#      claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
#      or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
#      You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
#  
#      (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
#      infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
#      Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
#      shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
#      unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
#      agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
#      royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
#      Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
#      the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
#      of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
#      mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
#      is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
#      Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
#      the 60 day notice period specified above.
#  
#      (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
#      Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
#      any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
#      and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
#      sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
#      Participant.
#  
#      8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
#      alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
#      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
#      by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
#      infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
#      granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
#      into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
#      license.
#  
#      8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
#      all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
#      which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
#      prior to termination shall survive termination.
#  
# 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
#  
#      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
#      (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
#      DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
#      OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
#      ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
#      CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
#      WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
#      COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
#      INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
#      LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
#      RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
#      PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
#      EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
#      THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
#  
# 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
#  
#      The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
#      48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
#      software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
#      terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
#      C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
#      all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
#      rights set forth herein.
#  
# 11. MISCELLANEOUS.
#  
#      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
#      matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
#      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
#      necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
#      California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
#      any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
#      With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
#      or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
#      States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
#      subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
#      District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
#      California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
#      without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
#      expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
#      Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
#      Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
#      shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
#      License.
#  
# 12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
#  
#      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
#      responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
#      out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
#      work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
#      responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
#      shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
#  
# 13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
#  
#      Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
#      "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
#      Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
#      Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
#      by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

#

#  
# IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA OR DATA USE, INCURRED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

# NOTICE OF RESTRICTED RIGHTS
# "Programs delivered subject to the DOD FAR Supplement are 'commercial computer software' and use, duplication, and disclosure of the programs, including documentation, shall be subject to the licensing restrictions set forth in the applicable Oracle license agreement. Otherwise, programs delivered subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations are 'restricted computer software' and use, duplication, and disclosure of the programs, including documentation, shall be subject to the restrictions in FAR 52.227-19, Commercial Computer Software-Restricted Rights (June 1987). Oracle USA, Inc., 500 Oracle Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065."
#  
# End of Agreement
# You may terminate this agreement by destroying all copies of the programs. We have the right to terminate your right to use the programs if you fail to comply with any of the terms of this agreement, in which case you shall destroy all copies of the programs.
#  
# Relationship Between the Parties
# The relationship between you and us is that of licensee/licensor. Neither party will represent that it has any authority to assume or create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other party, nor to represent the other party as agent, employee, franchisee, or in any other capacity. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to limit either party's right to independently develop or distribute software that is functionally similar to the other party's products, so long as proprietary information of the other party is not included in such software.
#  
# Open Source
# "Open Source" software - software available without charge for use, modification and distribution - is often licensed under terms that require the user to make the user's modifications to the Open Source software or any software that the user 'combines' with the Open Source software freely available in source code form. If you use Open Source software in conjunction with the programs, you must ensure that your use does not: (i) create, or purport to create, obligations of us with respect to the Oracle programs; or (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights to or immunities under our intellectual property or proprietary rights in the Oracle programs. For example, you may not develop a software program using an Oracle program and an Open Source program where such use results in a program file(s) that contains code from both the Oracle program and the Open Source program (including without limitation libraries) if the Open Source program is licensed under a license that requires any "modifications" be made freely available. You also may not combine the Oracle program with programs licensed under the GNU General Public License ("GPL") in any manner that could cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, the Oracle program or any modifications thereto to become subject to the terms of the GPL.
#  
# Entire Agreement
# You agree that this agreement is the complete agreement for the programs and licenses, and this agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations. If any term of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain effective.

# grant of the rights and licenses granted by this Agreement. TSI agrees
# to indemnify, defend and hold Licensee harmless from any and all
# actions, causes of action, claims, demands, reasonable costs,
# liabilities, reasonable expenses (including attorney's fees) and
# damages (collectively, a "Loss" or "Losses") arising from any claim
# that the Software Program infringes any copyright or patent, or other
# intellectual property right of a third party, provided, however:
# (1) Licensee shall promptly deliver to TSI notice in writing of any
#     claim for recovery under this section, and, if known, specify in
#     reasonable detail the nature of the Loss and the amount, or an
#     estimate of the amount, of the liability arising there-from.
#     Licensee shall, at TSI's expense, provide to TSI as promptly as
#     practicable thereafter information and documentation reasonably
#     requested by TSI to support and verify the claim assert-ed,
#     provided that, in so doing, it may restrict or condition any
#     disclosure in the interest of preserving privileges of importance
#     in any foreseeable litigation.
# (2) If the facts pertaining to the Loss arise out of the claim of a
#     third party, or if there is any claim against a third party
#     available by virtue of the circumstances of the Loss, TSI shall
#     assume the defense or the prosecution thereof, including the
#     employment of counsel or accountants, at its cost and expense.
#     Licensee shall have the right to employ counsel separate from
#     counsel employed by TSI in any such action and to participate
#     therein, but the fees and expenses of such counsel employed by
#     Licensee shall be at Licensee expense.  TSI shall have the right
#     to determine and adopt (or, in the case of a proposal by Licensee,
#     to approve) a settlement of such matter in its reasonable
#     discretion. TSI shall not be liable for any settlement of any
#     claim effected without its prior written consent, which shall not
#     be unreasonably withheld.  Whether or not TSI chooses to so
#     defend or prosecute such claim, Licensee and TSI shall cooperate
#     in the defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such
#     records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences,
#     discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be
#     reasonably requested in connection therewith.
# (3) If such a claim arises, or in either party's judgment is likely
#     to arise, Licensee agree to allow TSI, at TSI's option, to either
#     (i) procure the right to permit the continued exercise of the
#     rights and licenses in the Software Program granted under this
#     Agreement; (ii) replace or modify the Software Program so it
#     be-comes non-infringing, while affording equivalent performance;
#     or (iii) as its sole obligation, terminate the license for the
#     infringing Software Program and upon return thereof by Licensee,
#     refund the unearned portion of any license fees paid by Licensee
#     for the remainder of the current term hereof.
# (4) TSI shall have no indemnity obligation for claims of infringement
#     resulting from any combination, operation or use of the Software
#     Program, or any components thereof, with any software programs or
#     data not supplied by TSI if such infringement would have been
#     avoided by use of the Software Program alone. Licensee
#     acknowledges and agrees that these four items are the exclusive
#     remedy of Licensee for damages for breach of warranty or
#     representations contained in this Section 7.
# 
# 
# Section 8 - Termination
# 
# Should either party commit a material breach of its obligations
# hereunder, the other party may, at its option, terminate this
# Agreement by written notice to the party in default. Such notice
# shall identify and describe the default upon which termination is
# based. The defaulting party shall have thirty (30) days from the
# effective delivery of the notice to cure such default, which, if
# effected, shall prevent termination by virtue of such default.  Upon
# termination of this Agreement, Licensee will either return to TSI or
# destroy all copies of the Software Program and documentation then in
# your possession.  Licenses to the Software Program granted in the
# normal course of business by Licensee to your customers shall survive
# termination of this Agreement.  Licensee shall, within thirty (30)
# days after the date of such termination furnish TSI with a certificate
# of compliance in accordance with this Section.  The parties agree that
# TSI shall have the right to enforce the obligations arising under this
# Section by seeking specific performance and to enjoin or compel
# Licensee through injunctive relief. Licensee may retain a commercially
# reasonable number of copies of the Software Program and documentation
# solely for the purpose of supporting Licensee customers.
# 
# 
# Section 9 - Export Controls
# 
# Licensee shall comply with, and request of and/or notify Licensee
# sublicensees and resellers that they comply with, all applicable laws,
# regulations, rulings and executive orders of Japan relating to the
# export and re-export of Products containing the Software Program.
# Licensee shall not directly or indirectly export or re-export any
# Products containing the Software Program unless Licensee have obtained
# a license to do so if such a license is required.
# 
# 
# Section 10 - Entire Agreement
# 
# This Agreement, including any attachments, constitutes the entire
# agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
# and supersedes all prior agreements, both oral and written,
# representations, statements, negotiations and undertakings, with
# respect to the subject matter hereof, which such agreements,
# representations, statements, negotiations and undertakings are merged
# herein.  No amendment or modification of this Agreement or any
# provision or attachment of this Agreement shall be effective unless
# it is in writing and signed by both parties.
# 
# 
# Section 11 - Governing Law
# 
# The validity, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be
# governed by the substantive laws of Japan (excluding conflicts of law
# principles).  Each party hereto expressly consents to the personal
# jurisdiction of, and venue in, such courts. If any legal action is
# undertaken to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing
# party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs in
# addition to any other relief to which that party may be entitled.
# 
# 
# Section 12 - Assignment and Benefit
# 
# Without the consent of the other party in writing, neither party may
# assign this Agreement; provided, however, TSI or Licensee may assign
# this Agreement to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the respective
# corporation or a corporation in which the shareholders of the
# respective corporation own a majority interest of the voting control
# provided that the assigning party remains obligated hereunder;
# further provided, however, TSI or Licensee may assign this Agreement
# to another corporation which acquires or has acquired substantially
# all of the stock or assets of the assignor so long as, if the assignor
# is Licensee, the assignee's license to use the Software Program is
# limited to use in Products which were offered by Licensee to Licensee
# customers or potential customers and the assignee is prohibited from
# use of the Software Program in other products or parts of products
# developed, sold or distributed by the assignee.
# 
# This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of
# Licensee and TSI and each party's successors, subject to the other
# provisions of this Section.

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. 
#  
#  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License. 
#  
#    5. Submission of Contributions.

#  
#    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

#     terms for the components permit Customer to copy, modify, and
#     redistribute the component, in both source code and binary code
#     forms.  This agreement does not limit Customer's rights under, or
#     grant Customer rights that supersede, the license terms of any
#     particular component.
# 
# 2.  Intellectual Property Rights.  The Software and each of its
#     components, including the source code, documentation, appearance,

#     found at http://www.redhat.com/about/corporate/trademark/ before
#     distributing a copy of the Software, regardless of whether it has
#     been modified.  If Customer makes a commercial redistribution of
#     the Software, unless a separate agreement with Red Hat is executed
#     or other permission granted, then Customer must modify the files
#     identified as ?REDHAT-LOGOS? and ?anaconda-images? to remove all
#     images containing the ?Red Hat? trademark or the ?Shadowman? logo.
#     Merely deleting these files may corrupt the Software.
# 
# 3.  Limited Warranty.  Except as specifically stated in this agreement
#     or a license for a particular component, to the maximum extent
#     permitted under applicable law, the Software and the components
#     are provided and licensed ?as is? without warranty of any kind,
#     expressed or implied, including the implied warranties of
#     merchantability, non-infringement or fitness for a particular
#     purpose.  Red Hat does not warrant that the functions contained in
#     the Software will meet Customer's requirements or that the
#     operation of the Software will be entirely error free or appear
#     precisely as described in the accompanying documentation. This
#     warranty extends only to the party that purchases the Software
#     from Red Hat or a Red Hat authorized distributor.
# 
# 4.  Limitation of Remedies and Liability. To the maximum extent
#     permitted by applicable law, the remedies described below are
#     accepted by Customer as its only remedies.  Red Hat's entire
#     liability, and Customer's exclusive remedies, shall be: If the
#     Software media is defective, Customer may return it within 30 days
#     of delivery along with a copy of Customer's payment receipt and
#     Red Hat, at its option, will replace it or refund the money paid
#     by Customer for the Software.  To the maximum extent permitted by
#     applicable law, Red Hat or any Red Hat authorized dealer will not
#     be liable to Customer for any incidental or consequential damages,
#     including lost profits or lost savings arising out of the use or
#     inability to use the Software, even if Red Hat or such dealer has
#     been advised of the possibility of such damages.  In no event
#     shall Red Hat's liability under this agreement exceed the amount
#     that Customer paid to Red Hat under this agreement during the
#     twelve months preceding the action.

#     and agrees that if it is in the United States and exports or
#     transfers the Software to eligible end users, it will, as required
#     by EAR Section 741.17(e), submit semi-annual reports to the
#     Commerce Department?s Bureau of Industry & Security (BIS), which

#     transferee; and (f) understands that countries other than the
#     United States may restrict the import, use, or export of
#     encryption products and that it shall be solely responsible for
#     compliance with any such import, use, or export restrictions.

# 6.  Third Party Programs. Red Hat may distribute third party software
#     programs with the Software that are not part of the Software.
#     These third party programs are subject to their own license terms.
#     The license terms either accompany the programs or can be viewed
#     at http://www.redhat.com/licenses/.  If Customer does not agree to

#     Customer may not install them.  If Customer wishes to install the
#     programs on more than one system or transfer the programs to
#     another party, then Customer must contact the licensor of the
#     programs.
