# 2.  本製品がプログラムのアルファ バージョンもしくはベータ バージョン（以下、「ベータ プログラム」または「ベータ バージョン」と表記します）であり、その時点で完成版ではない場合、CA は完成版リリースがベータ プログラムと同一であること、および完成版リリースが再インストールを必要としないことを保障するものではありません。ライセンス契約者は、サポートに登録した場合、またはその他にCAが必要であると認めた場合、本製品の使用経験に関する特定の情報をCAに対して提供することに同意するものとします。ライセンス契約者は、本製品のベータ バージョンが（a）テスト目的にのみ使用され、CAが書面にて承諾した場合を除き本番稼働されないこと、（b）テストおよびデバッグが完了していない試験的なプログラムであり、付属する文書が最終版でない場合も多くあることに同意し、この事実を承諾するものとします。ライセンス契約者は、本製品のベータ バージョンの完全性、正確性、およびライセンス契約者による使用または操作に関して、CAが一切の表明を行わないことに同意するものとします。本製品のベータ バージョンは「現状有姿」の状態で供与されます。本製品のベータ バージョンに対しては、あらゆる権原または不侵害に対するすべての保証や表明を含むがそれらに限定しない、明示または黙示のいかなる保証または表明も行われません。ライセンス契約者が本製品のベータ バージョンのテスター（本製品のベータ バージョン入手前の登録時に同意したベータ テストまたはリリース前テスト用の契約条件（以下、「ベータ テスト契約」と表記します）に定められています）である場合、ライセンス契約者は、本契約条件がベータ テスト契約の追加条件であり、ベータ テスト契約が本契約条件よりも優先して適用されることに同意するものとします。
# 
# 3.  本製品のライセンスが試用版または評価版として供与された場合、ライセンス契約者は、第1項で定めた制限に従って、30日間または別途定められた日数の試用期間（以下、「試用期間」と表記します）の間、本製品を評価目的でのみ使用することに同意するものとします。ライセンス契約者の本製品を使用する権利は、試用期間の終了と共に自動的に失効します。また、ライセンス契約者は試用期間の終了と同時に本製品をアンインストールし、本製品の部分的コピーを含むすべてのコピーをCAに返却するか、ライセンス契約者のコンピュータ ライブラリまたは記憶装置（あるいはその両方）から本製品の部分的コピーを含むすべてのコピーが削除および廃棄された旨をCAに対して書面にて保証することに同意するものとします。ライセンス契約者が試用期間の終了後も本製品の使用継続を希望する場合は、CAまたはCAの関連会社に連絡し所定の料金を支払って、本製品のライセンスを取得するものとします。試用期間中にライセンス契約者が本製品を使用する場合、本製品は「現状有姿」の状態で提供されるものとし、いかなる保証もされません。またCAは、試用期間中の本製品に関して、商品性ならびに特定用途に対する適合性に関する黙示の保証、および本契約で明示に定められているすべての保証を含むがそれらに限定しない、すべての保証から免責されます。
# 
# 4.  本製品にソフトウェア開発キット（以下、「SDK」と表記します）が含まれる場合、本段落の条項のみが SDK の使用に適用されます。SDKには、ソフトウェア、API、および関連ドキュメントが含まれる場合があります。ライセンス契約者は、提供されたSDKを、ライセンス契約者の内部的な目的にのみ使用できます。ここで言う内部的な目的とは、本製品をサード パーティ製のソフトウェアまたはハードウェアと統合するためのソフトウェアを開発するか、または本製品と連携して機能するソフトウェア（エージェントなど）を開発することを指します。SDKは、ライセンス契約者による本製品の内部的な使用を拡張する目的でのみ、ライセンス契約者に提供されます。ライセンス契約者に対して、本製品を配布する権利はいっさい付与されません。下記の第8項に定める制限に加えて、ライセンス契約者は、SDK、関連ドキュメント、およびSDKの実行可能なバージョンを含むいかなるアプリケーションも、第三者に対して、またはインターネット上で、コピー、開示、取引、または配布してはならず、また認定使用制限に抵触する形で使用してはなりません。本項に定める条件が、本使用条件に定められている他の条件と矛盾する場合は、SDKの使用に限り、本項の条件が優先して適用されます。
# 
# 本使用条件に定められている他の規定にかかわらず、準拠法によって許容される範囲内で、SDKは「現状有姿」の状態で提供されライセンスされるものとし、いかなる保証もなされません。

# 
# 6.

# 
# 9. CAは、CAが本契約を締結することができることを保証します。またCAは、CAに本契約を締結する権限がないという第三者による申し立て、およびライセンス契約者が本契約に従って本製品を使用したことで、ライセンス契約者が本製品の入手時点で使用を許可された地域内において米国の特許権、著作権を侵害したという第三者による申し立てによって生じる損害からライセンス契約者を免責し、自己の選択により和解することを保証します。同時にCAは、ライセンス契約者への本製品の引き渡し後90日間は、配布された製品がドキュメントに記載されている公開された仕様に従って実質的に動作することを保証します。ただし、CAが負うべき責任は、業界標準に鑑みて欠陥を是正するために合理的な努力をすることに限定されます。CAがライセンス契約者から書面にて上記保証の不履行に関する申し立てを受領してから、合理的に相当な期間内に（a）第三者の知的所有権を侵害せずに、または（b）CAの仕様書に従って、実質的に本製品を動作させることができない場合、CAは当該ライセンスを解除し、ライセンス契約者または認定CA再販業者に対して、支払われたライセンス料金および（または）サポートおよび保守料金を比例配分により返金する手続きを行うことができるものとします。かかる解除が行われた場合、返金額は（i）該当する注文書に記載されている本期間の残り月数に基づく比例配分によって計算するか、（ii）本製品が無期限でライセンス契約されている場合は、（返金額の算出目的に限り）3年償却ベースの比例配分によって計算します。本項で定めた保証は、本製品のベータ版、試用版、評価版、デモバージョン、またはSDKには適用されません。以下の場合、CAは保証の要求に対して補償または救済を行う義務を負わないものとします。（i）申し立てられた侵害または保証の要求が本製品の改変の結果生じたものであり、その改変がCAによるものではない場合。（ii）本製品がCAの仕様書、関連ドキュメント、ガイドラインに則って使用されていない場合。（iii）CAが提供するアップデートまたはパッチを使用することにより、申し立てられた侵害または保証の要求が回避できるか除去できる場合。（iv）申し立てられた侵害または保証の要求が、本製品を何らかの第三者製品と組み合わせて使用したことによる結果である場合。（v）本製品の所定の料金が期日を過ぎても支払われていないか、ライセンス契約者が本契約に違反している場合。ライセンス契約者の特定の指示に基づいてCAが作成した製品に関しては、本書に記載された免責は適用されず、CAはいかなる責任も負わないものとします。上に述べられた規定は、侵害の申し立てに対するCAの責任と義務の全てであり、また実際の侵害や侵害の申し立て、または知的財産やその他財産権の不正使用に関連してライセンス契約者に対して使用できる唯一の救済手段です。

# 
# 13.  ライセンス契約者が該当するメンテナンス料を支払わなかった場合、メンテナンスを再開するためには、メンテナンス料が支払われなかった各年に対して、その時点で有効なCAのメンテナンス料の150%をライセンス契約者がCAまたは各CA関連会社に対して支払う必要があるものとします。
# 
# 14.  裁判所によって本契約のいずれかの条件規定が違法、無効、または執行不能だと判断された場合も、その他の条件規定はすべて完全な執行力および効力を持つものとします。本使用条件のいずれかの契約条件への違反に対する権利を放棄しても、当該契約条件以外の条件への違反に対する権利を放棄したことにはならず、また当該権利の放棄は当該権利を放棄する当事者から権限を与えられた代表者が書面にて行わないかぎり無効とします。本契約に関するご質問は、CA, Inc.の Worldwide Law Department、One CA Plaza, Islandia, NY 11749までお問い合わせ下さい。

THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
#  
# 6. TERMINATION.
#  
# 6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
#  
# 6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as 'Participant') alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
#  
# 8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
#  
# The Covered Software is a 'commercial item,' as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of 'commercial computer software' (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. Ã?'Ã?Â§ 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and 'commercial computer software documentation' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.

#  
# 9. MISCELLANEOUS.
#  
# This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
#  
# 10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
#  
# As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

#           as part of a Larger Work; and
#  
#           (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or

#  
#           (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or
#           trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,

#  
#           (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are

#           3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of
#           Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made

#           Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims
#           infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
#           that Contributor.
#  
# 3. Distribution Obligations.
#  
#      3.1. Application of License.
#      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
#      governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
#      Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
#      distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
#      of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
#      copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
#      distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
#      version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
#      License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
#      an additional document offering the additional rights described in
#      Section 3.5.
#  
#      3.2. Availability of Source Code.
#      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
#      made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
#      either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
#      Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
#      Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
#      Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
#      months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
#      (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
#      has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
#      ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
#      Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
#  
#      3.3. Description of Modifications.
#      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
#      file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
#      the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
#      the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
#      Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
#      Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
#      Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
#      origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
#  
#      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
#           (a) Third Party Claims.
#           If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
#           intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
#           granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
#           Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
#           distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
#           party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
#           know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
#           the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
#           Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
#           Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
#           (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
#           reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
#           Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
#  
#           (b) Contributor APIs.
#           If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
#           interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
#           are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
#           also include this information in the LEGAL file.
#  
#                (c)    Representations.
#           Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
#           Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
#           Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
#           Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
#           this License.
#  
#      3.5. Required Notices.
#      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
#      Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
#      Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
#      location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
#      to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
#      You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
#      Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
#      for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
#      rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
#      charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
#      obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
#      may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
#      Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
#      any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
#      offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
#      Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
#      Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
#      support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
#  
#      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
#      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
#      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
#      and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
#      the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
#      including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
#      obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
#      in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
#      collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
#      Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
#      Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
#      contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
#      compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
#      Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
#      rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
#      License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
#      license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
#      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
#      Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
#      Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
#      the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
#      terms You offer.
#  
#      3.7. Larger Works.
#      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
#      not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
#      Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
#      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
#  
# 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
#  
#      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
#      License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
#      statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
#      the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
#      describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
#      must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
#      be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
#      extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
#      sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
#      understand it.
#  
# 5. Application of this License.
#  
#      This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
#      attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
#  
# 6. Versions of the License.
#  
#      6.1. New Versions.
#      Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
#      and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
#      will be given a distinguishing version number.
#  
#      6.2. Effect of New Versions.
#      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
#      License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
#      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
#      of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
#      other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
#      Covered Code created under this License.
#  
#      6.3. Derivative Works.
#      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
#      only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
#      governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
#      the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
#      "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
#      license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
#      and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
#      contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
#      Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
#      Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
#      Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
#      this License.)
#  
# 7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
#  
#      COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
#      WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
#      WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
#      DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
#      THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
#      IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
#      YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
#      COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
#      OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
#      ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
#  
# 8. TERMINATION.
#  
#      8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
#      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
#      such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
#      sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
#      survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
#      nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
#      shall survive.
#  
#      8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
#      claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
#      or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
#      You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
#  
#      (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
#      infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
#      Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
#      shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
#      unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
#      agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
#      royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
#      Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
#      the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
#      of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
#      mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
#      is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
#      Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
#      the 60 day notice period specified above.
#  
#      (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
#      Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
#      any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
#      and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
#      sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
#      Participant.
#  
#      8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
#      alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
#      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
#      by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
#      infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
#      granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
#      into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
#      license.
#  
#      8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
#      all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
#      which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
#      prior to termination shall survive termination.
#  
# 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
#  
#      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
#      (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
#      DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
#      OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
#      ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
#      CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
#      WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
#      COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
#      INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
#      LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
#      RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
#      PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
#      EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
#      THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

# NOTICE OF RESTRICTED RIGHTS
# "Programs delivered subject to the DOD FAR Supplement are 'commercial computer software' and use, duplication, and disclosure of the programs, including documentation, shall be subject to the licensing restrictions set forth in the applicable Oracle license agreement. Otherwise, programs delivered subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations are 'restricted computer software' and use, duplication, and disclosure of the programs, including documentation, shall be subject to the restrictions in FAR 52.227-19, Commercial Computer Software-Restricted Rights (June 1987). Oracle USA, Inc., 500 Oracle Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065."
#  
# End of Agreement
# You may terminate this agreement by destroying all copies of the programs. We have the right to terminate your right to use the programs if you fail to comply with any of the terms of this agreement, in which case you shall destroy all copies of the programs.
#  
# Relationship Between the Parties
# The relationship between you and us is that of licensee/licensor. Neither party will represent that it has any authority to assume or create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other party, nor to represent the other party as agent, employee, franchisee, or in any other capacity. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to limit either party's right to independently develop or distribute software that is functionally similar to the other party's products, so long as proprietary information of the other party is not included in such software.
#  
# Open Source
# "Open Source" software - software available without charge for use, modification and distribution - is often licensed under terms that require the user to make the user's modifications to the Open Source software or any software that the user 'combines' with the Open Source software freely available in source code form. If you use Open Source software in conjunction with the programs, you must ensure that your use does not: (i) create, or purport to create, obligations of us with respect to the Oracle programs; or (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights to or immunities under our intellectual property or proprietary rights in the Oracle programs. For example, you may not develop a software program using an Oracle program and an Open Source program where such use results in a program file(s) that contains code from both the Oracle program and the Open Source program (including without limitation libraries) if the Open Source program is licensed under a license that requires any "modifications" be made freely available. You also may not combine the Oracle program with programs licensed under the GNU General Public License ("GPL") in any manner that could cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, the Oracle program or any modifications thereto to become subject to the terms of the GPL.
#  
# Entire Agreement
# You agree that this agreement is the complete agreement for the programs and licenses, and this agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations. If any term of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain effective.

# 
# Software Warranty: TSI warrants that, for a period of ninety (90) days
# from the initial delivery of the software to Licensee, the Software,
# if used by Licensee in accordance with the Documentation, shall
# operate in material conformity with the Documentation for such
# Software. TSI does not warrant that the Software will meet all of
# Licensee requirements or that the use of the Software will be
# uninterrupted or error free. TSI's entire liability, and Licensee
# exclusive remedy, under this limited Software Warranty shall be for
# TSI (i) to attempt, through reasonable efforts, to correct any
# reproducible material nonconformity discovered within the ninety (90)
# day warranty period; or (ii) to replace the nonconforming Software
# with Software which conforms to the foregoing warranty. In the event
# TSI is unable to cure the breach of warranty described in this
# Section 6, after attempting the remedies described in (i) and (ii)
# above, Licensee may return the Software and TSI shall refund any
# license and maintenance fees paid by Licensee to TSI for the Software.
# The above remedies are available only if TSI is promptly notified in
# writing, within the warranty period, upon discovery of the
# nonconformity by Licensee and TSI's examination of the Software
# discloses that such nonconformity exists, and that the Software has
# not been (i) altered or modified, other than by TSI, (ii) subjected to
# negligence, or computer or electrical malfunctions, or (iii) used,
# adjusted, or installed other than in accordance with the
# Documentation.  Maintenance Services and Other Services Warranty: TSI
# warrants that any Maintenance Services or other Services performed
# pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be performed in a
# professional and workmanlike manner consistent with generally accepted
# industry standards. TSI's entire liability and Licensee exclusive
# remedy under this limited Maintenance Services and Other Services
# Warranty shall be for Licensee to recover the fees paid for such
# nonconforming services
# 
# Disclaimer: THE EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTIES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE
# EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR
# STATUTORY WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, AND TSI EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS
# ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
# MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
# 
# Limitation of Liability: EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS MADE UNDER SECTION 7
# (INDEMNIFICATION), IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S LIABILITY
# ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT
# EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID OR DUE TO TSI HEREUNDER. IN NO EVENT SHALL
# EITHER PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR
# CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR
# LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE
# GOODS OR SERVICES, ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT UNDER ANY
# CAUSE OF ACTION, WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
# THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY
# NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED
# REMEDY.
# 
# Warranty Claims: Any claims made by Licensee for the breach of a
# warranty set forth in this Section 6, shall be made in writing and
# delivered in writing to TSI, and Licensee shall provide TSI a
# reproducible test case, if applicable, demonstrating the breach of
# warranty.
# 
# 
# Section 7 - Indemnification
# 
# TSI warrants that the use or distribution of unaltered Software
# Program(s), or the exercise of the licenses granted hereunder, will
# not infringe any copyright or patent, or other intellectual property
# rights of any third party, and TSI has all rights necessary for the
# grant of the rights and licenses granted by this Agreement. TSI agrees
# to indemnify, defend and hold Licensee harmless from any and all
# actions, causes of action, claims, demands, reasonable costs,
# liabilities, reasonable expenses (including attorney's fees) and
# damages (collectively, a "Loss" or "Losses") arising from any claim
# that the Software Program infringes any copyright or patent, or other
# intellectual property right of a third party, provided, however:
# (1) Licensee shall promptly deliver to TSI notice in writing of any
#     claim for recovery under this section, and, if known, specify in
#     reasonable detail the nature of the Loss and the amount, or an
#     estimate of the amount, of the liability arising there-from.
#     Licensee shall, at TSI's expense, provide to TSI as promptly as
#     practicable thereafter information and documentation reasonably
#     requested by TSI to support and verify the claim assert-ed,
#     provided that, in so doing, it may restrict or condition any
#     disclosure in the interest of preserving privileges of importance
#     in any foreseeable litigation.
# (2) If the facts pertaining to the Loss arise out of the claim of a
#     third party, or if there is any claim against a third party
#     available by virtue of the circumstances of the Loss, TSI shall
#     assume the defense or the prosecution thereof, including the
#     employment of counsel or accountants, at its cost and expense.
#     Licensee shall have the right to employ counsel separate from
#     counsel employed by TSI in any such action and to participate
#     therein, but the fees and expenses of such counsel employed by
#     Licensee shall be at Licensee expense.  TSI shall have the right
#     to determine and adopt (or, in the case of a proposal by Licensee,
#     to approve) a settlement of such matter in its reasonable
#     discretion. TSI shall not be liable for any settlement of any
#     claim effected without its prior written consent, which shall not
#     be unreasonably withheld.  Whether or not TSI chooses to so
#     defend or prosecute such claim, Licensee and TSI shall cooperate
#     in the defense or prosecution thereof and shall furnish such
#     records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences,
#     discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be
#     reasonably requested in connection therewith.
# (3) If such a claim arises, or in either party's judgment is likely
#     to arise, Licensee agree to allow TSI, at TSI's option, to either
#     (i) procure the right to permit the continued exercise of the
#     rights and licenses in the Software Program granted under this
#     Agreement; (ii) replace or modify the Software Program so it
#     be-comes non-infringing, while affording equivalent performance;
#     or (iii) as its sole obligation, terminate the license for the
#     infringing Software Program and upon return thereof by Licensee,
#     refund the unearned portion of any license fees paid by Licensee
#     for the remainder of the current term hereof.
# (4) TSI shall have no indemnity obligation for claims of infringement
#     resulting from any combination, operation or use of the Software
#     Program, or any components thereof, with any software programs or
#     data not supplied by TSI if such infringement would have been
#     avoided by use of the Software Program alone. Licensee
#     acknowledges and agrees that these four items are the exclusive
#     remedy of Licensee for damages for breach of warranty or
#     representations contained in this Section 7.
# 
# 
# Section 8 - Termination
# 
# Should either party commit a material breach of its obligations
# hereunder, the other party may, at its option, terminate this
# Agreement by written notice to the party in default. Such notice
# shall identify and describe the default upon which termination is
# based. The defaulting party shall have thirty (30) days from the
# effective delivery of the notice to cure such default, which, if
# effected, shall prevent termination by virtue of such default.  Upon
# termination of this Agreement, Licensee will either return to TSI or
# destroy all copies of the Software Program and documentation then in
# your possession.  Licenses to the Software Program granted in the
# normal course of business by Licensee to your customers shall survive
# termination of this Agreement.  Licensee shall, within thirty (30)
# days after the date of such termination furnish TSI with a certificate
# of compliance in accordance with this Section.  The parties agree that
# TSI shall have the right to enforce the obligations arising under this
# Section by seeking specific performance and to enjoin or compel
# Licensee through injunctive relief. Licensee may retain a commercially
# reasonable number of copies of the Software Program and documentation
# solely for the purpose of supporting Licensee customers.
# 
# 
# Section 9 - Export Controls
# 
# Licensee shall comply with, and request of and/or notify Licensee
# sublicensees and resellers that they comply with, all applicable laws,
# regulations, rulings and executive orders of Japan relating to the
# export and re-export of Products containing the Software Program.
# Licensee shall not directly or indirectly export or re-export any
# Products containing the Software Program unless Licensee have obtained
# a license to do so if such a license is required.
# 
# 
# Section 10 - Entire Agreement
# 
# This Agreement, including any attachments, constitutes the entire
# agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
# and supersedes all prior agreements, both oral and written,
# representations, statements, negotiations and undertakings, with
# respect to the subject matter hereof, which such agreements,
# representations, statements, negotiations and undertakings are merged
# herein.  No amendment or modification of this Agreement or any
# provision or attachment of this Agreement shall be effective unless
# it is in writing and signed by both parties.
# 
# 
# Section 11 - Governing Law
# 
# The validity, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be
# governed by the substantive laws of Japan (excluding conflicts of law
# principles).  Each party hereto expressly consents to the personal
# jurisdiction of, and venue in, such courts. If any legal action is
# undertaken to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing
# party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs in
# addition to any other relief to which that party may be entitled.
# 
# 
# Section 12 - Assignment and Benefit
# 
# Without the consent of the other party in writing, neither party may
# assign this Agreement; provided, however, TSI or Licensee may assign
# this Agreement to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the respective
# corporation or a corporation in which the shareholders of the
# respective corporation own a majority interest of the voting control
# provided that the assigning party remains obligated hereunder;
# further provided, however, TSI or Licensee may assign this Agreement
# to another corporation which acquires or has acquired substantially
# all of the stock or assets of the assignor so long as, if the assignor
# is Licensee, the assignee's license to use the Software Program is
# limited to use in Products which were offered by Licensee to Licensee
# customers or potential customers and the assignee is prohibited from
# use of the Software Program in other products or parts of products
# developed, sold or distributed by the assignee.
# 
# This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of
# Licensee and TSI and each party's successors, subject to the other
# provisions of this Section.

# LICENSE AGREEMENT AND LIMITED PRODUCT WARRANTY
# RED HATÃƒ?Ã¢??Ãƒ?Ã‚Â® ENTERPRISE LINUXÃƒ?Ã¢??Ãƒ?Ã‚Â® VERSION 4
# 
# This agreement governs the use of the Software and any updates to the
# Software, regardless of the delivery mechanism.  The Software is a
# collective work under U.S. Copyright Law.  Subject to the following
# terms, Red Hat, Inc. (?Red Hat?) grants to the user (?Customer?) a
# license to this collective work pursuant to the GNU General Public
# License.
# 
# 1.  The Software.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux (the ?Software?) is a
#     modular operating system consisting of hundreds of software
#     components.  The end user license agreement for each component is
#     located in the component's source code.  With the exception of
#     certain image files identified in Section 2 below, the license
#     terms for the components permit Customer to copy, modify, and
#     redistribute the component, in both source code and binary code
#     forms.  This agreement does not limit Customer's rights under, or
#     grant Customer rights that supersede, the license terms of any
#     particular component.
# 
# 2.  Intellectual Property Rights.  The Software and each of its
#     components, including the source code, documentation, appearance,
#     structure and organization are owned by Red Hat and others and are
#     protected under copyright and other laws.  Title to the Software
#     and any component, or to any copy, modification, or merged portion
#     shall remain with the aforementioned, subject to the applicable
#     license.  The ?Red Hat? trademark and the ?Shadowman? logo are
#     registered trademarks of Red Hat in the U.S. and other countries.
#     This agreement does not permit Customer to distribute the Software
#     using Red Hat's trademarks.  Customer should read the information
#     found at http://www.redhat.com/about/corporate/trademark/ before
#     distributing a copy of the Software, regardless of whether it has
#     been modified.  If Customer makes a commercial redistribution of
#     the Software, unless a separate agreement with Red Hat is executed
#     or other permission granted, then Customer must modify the files
#     identified as ?REDHAT-LOGOS? and ?anaconda-images? to remove all
#     images containing the ?Red Hat? trademark or the ?Shadowman? logo.
#     Merely deleting these files may corrupt the Software.
# 
# 3.  Limited Warranty.  Except as specifically stated in this agreement
#     or a license for a particular component, to the maximum extent
#     permitted under applicable law, the Software and the components
#     are provided and licensed ?as is? without warranty of any kind,
#     expressed or implied, including the implied warranties of
#     merchantability, non-infringement or fitness for a particular
#     purpose.  Red Hat does not warrant that the functions contained in
#     the Software will meet Customer's requirements or that the
#     operation of the Software will be entirely error free or appear
#     precisely as described in the accompanying documentation. This
#     warranty extends only to the party that purchases the Software
#     from Red Hat or a Red Hat authorized distributor.
# 
# 4.  Limitation of Remedies and Liability. To the maximum extent
#     permitted by applicable law, the remedies described below are
#     accepted by Customer as its only remedies.  Red Hat's entire
#     liability, and Customer's exclusive remedies, shall be: If the
#     Software media is defective, Customer may return it within 30 days
#     of delivery along with a copy of Customer's payment receipt and
#     Red Hat, at its option, will replace it or refund the money paid
#     by Customer for the Software.  To the maximum extent permitted by
#     applicable law, Red Hat or any Red Hat authorized dealer will not
#     be liable to Customer for any incidental or consequential damages,
#     including lost profits or lost savings arising out of the use or
#     inability to use the Software, even if Red Hat or such dealer has
#     been advised of the possibility of such damages.  In no event
#     shall Red Hat's liability under this agreement exceed the amount
#     that Customer paid to Red Hat under this agreement during the
#     twelve months preceding the action.
# 
# 5.  Export Control.  As required by U.S. law, Customer represents and
#     warrants that it: (a) understands that the Software is subject to
#     export controls under the U.S. Commerce Department?s Export
#     Administration Regulations (?EAR?); (b) is not located in a
#     prohibited destination country under the EAR or U.S. sanctions
#     regulations (currently Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan
#     and Syria); (c) will not export, re-export, or transfer the
#     Software to any prohibited destination, entity, or individual
#     without the necessary export license(s) or authorizations(s) from
#     the U.S. Government; (d) will not use or transfer the Software for
#     use in any sensitive nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, or
#     missile technology end-uses unless authorized by the
#     U.S. Government by regulation or specific license; (e) understands
#     and agrees that if it is in the United States and exports or
#     transfers the Software to eligible end users, it will, as required
#     by EAR Section 741.17(e), submit semi-annual reports to the
#     Commerce Department?s Bureau of Industry & Security (BIS), which
#     include the name and address (including country) of each
#     transferee; and (f) understands that countries other than the
#     United States may restrict the import, use, or export of
#     encryption products and that it shall be solely responsible for
#     compliance with any such import, use, or export restrictions.
# 
# 6.  Third Party Programs. Red Hat may distribute third party software
#     programs with the Software that are not part of the Software.
#     These third party programs are subject to their own license terms.
#     The license terms either accompany the programs or can be viewed
#     at http://www.redhat.com/licenses/.  If Customer does not agree to
#     abide by the applicable license terms for such programs, then
#     Customer may not install them.  If Customer wishes to install the
#     programs on more than one system or transfer the programs to
#     another party, then Customer must contact the licensor of the
#     programs.
# 
# 7.  General.  If any provision of this agreement is held to be
#     unenforceable, that shall not affect the enforceability of the
#     remaining provisions.  This agreement shall be governed by the
#     laws of the State of North Carolina and of the United States,
#     without regard to any conflict of laws provisions, except that the
#     United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods shall
#     not apply.

# 4. Limitation of Remedies and Liability. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, User's exclusive remedy under this EULA is to return any defective media within 30 days of delivery along with a copy of User's payment receipt and Red Hat, at its option, will replace it or refund the money paid by User for the media. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, neither Red Hat, any Red Hat authorized distributor, nor the licensor of any component provided to User under this EULA will be liable to User for any incidental or consequential damages, including lost profits or lost savings arising out of the use or inability to use the Programs or any component, even if Red Hat, such authorized distributor or licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
